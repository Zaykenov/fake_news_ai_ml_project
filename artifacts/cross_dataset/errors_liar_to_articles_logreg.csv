,fake_true,HOW DOES YOUR STATE’S ECONOMY RANK? Washington DC’s Ranking And #1 State May Surprise You,"Thanks to Obama s promise to shut down the coal industry, West Virginia comes in at #50. It s also interesting to note where Washington DC ranks in the nations best economies and why.Business Insider ranked the economies of these states, and DC s, on seven measures: unemployment rates, gross domestic product per capita, average weekly wages, and recent growth rates for non-farm payroll jobs, GDP, house prices, and wages.While they didn t factor them into the ranking, they also looked at the Fortune 1000 companies that have their headquarters in each state and which industries were disproportionately important in each state. This helped us get a little more insight into what makes each state economy tick.For more details on methodology and sources, click here.51. MississippiMississippi came in last in our ranking of state economies. Chicken, soybean, cotton, and rice farming are among the state s most disproportionately large employers.Mississippi had the lowest 2014 GDP per capita of any of the states, at just $35,019, and the lowest Q4 2014 weekly wage, at $747. The rate at which both of those measures was changing were also weak: Mississippi had the second-lowest GDP growth rate, with state GDP shrinking by 1.2%. The average weekly wage grew just 2.3% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014.50. West VirginiaWest Virginia was one of just two states in which fewer people were working in June 2015 than in June 2015, with a drop of 1.2% in nonfarm payrolls over the year. The Appalachian state was also one of only three states where housing prices dropped between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, and had the biggest drop in the state housing price index, falling 3.90%. One bright spot was that GDP grew by 5.1% in 2014, higher than the national rate of 2.2%.49. AlabamaAlabama s 2014 per capita GDP of $41,127 was far lower than the US per capita GDP of $54,307. GDP growth was also slower than in other states, increasing just 0.7% in 2014. Alabama s housing market remains lackluster, with housing prices rising just 1.8% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015.48. New MexicoNew Mexico has a large mining sector: About 18,000 New Mexicans are employed in support activities for mining. The state, home to research institutions like the University of New Mexico and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, also has a disproportionately large number of people employed in science, with about 22,000 private sector physics, engineering, and biological-research employees.New Mexico s June unemployment rate of 6.4% was a bit higher than the national rate of 5.3%, and its housing market was sluggish, with home prices rising just 1.46% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015. One bright spot is wage growth, with the weekly average wage in the state jumping 4.4% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014.47. MissouriMissouri is home to 26 Fortune 1000 companies, including Emerson Electric, agricultural giant Monsanto, O Reilly Automotive, and Energizer.Missouri had a low rate of employment growth, with nonfarm payrolls growing just 0.8% between June 2014 and June 2015. The state was slightly below average on all our other metrics, like its 5.8% June 2015 unemployment rate, higher than the national rate of 5.3%.46. MaineShipbuilding and maintenance jobs are disproportionately common in Maine, home to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, one of the four main shipyards used by the US Navy. The federal government employs about 4,700 workers in these industries.Maine saw low GDP growth in 2014 of only 0.2%. Maine s housing market was also slow, seeing only a 1.07% increase in housing prices. Maine s average weekly wage of $826 was also a bit lower than the national average of $1,035.45. ArkansasWhile home to corporate giants like Walmart, which sits at the very top of the Fortune 500 list, and food-processing conglomerate Tyson Foods, Arkansas  economy overall is weaker than that of most states.Arkansas  per capita GDP was $40,924, well below the US GDP per capita of $54,307. Similarly, the state s average weekly wage of $807 was quite a bit lower than the US average wage of $1,035 per week. However, the state s wage situation is improving: Wages rose by 4.5% from Q4 2013 to Q4 2014, the fifth highest wage-growth rate among the states.44. New Jersey The Garden State is home to the headquarters of several large corporations, including Johnson & Johnson, Prudential Financial, Merck, and Honeywell International. Although Atlantic City has seen better times, about 23,000 New Jerseyans are employed at casino hotels, about three times the national rate of employment in this industry.New Jersey had some rather extreme scores on our measures. While New Jersey s GDP per capita of $61,433 and average weekly wage of $1,211 were among the highest in the country, the growth rates for these two measures were far weaker: GDP grew just 0.4% in 2014, and wages rose just 2.0% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014, much lower than the 3.5% change nationwide.43. KansasKansas  economy has huge agriculture and aerospace sectors. Among the most disproportionately common jobs in Kansas are livestock wholesalers, cattle ranchers, turkey producers, and airplane manufacturers.Kansas  over the year wage growth of 2.6% was somewhat weaker than the national rate of 3.5% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014. Job growth was also below average, with nonfarm payrolls growing by only 0.8% between June 2014 and June 2015. Despite the slow change in employment, Kansas  June 2015 unemployment rate of 4.5% was quite a bit lower than the national 5.3% rate.42. VirginiaWith its proximity to the nation s capital and several key military installations, it s not surprising that government and military activities play a disproportionately large role in Virginia s economy. About 38,000 Virginians are employed in the shipbuilding industry, and 64,000 are employed by the federal government in national-security positions.This heavy government and defense presence also shows up in Virginia s Fortune 1000 companies: Among the big companies headquartered in Virginia are the government-backed Freddie Mac, and defense contractors General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman.Virginia s job growth was mediocre and its GDP growth was weaker than most states. Nonfarm payroll jobs increased by 1.3% between June 2014 and June 2015, and the state s GDP was flat in 2014, growing 0.0%. A more positive measure for Virginia was the state s average weekly wage of $1,057, just above the national average of $1,035.41. IllinoisSeveral iconic companies call Illinois home, like airplane builder Boeing, pharmacy giant Walgreens, insurance companies State Farm and Allstate, and the troubled burger sellers of McDonald s.While Illinois  weekly average wage of $1,089 is better than that of most other states, wage growth has been slower, with wages rising just 2.8% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014.40. ArizonaAnchored by the metropolis of Phoenix, Arizona has a diverse economy. Among the most disproportionately large industries are mining, professional organizations, financial processing, and electronics manufacturing.Arizona s housing market is recovering well, with housing prices rising 6.03% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, a bit faster than the national change of 4.96%. However, the state s GDP per capita is somewhat lower than in other areas, at just $42,213, about $12,000 lower than the US per capita GDP of $54,307.39. LouisianaShipping services, sugar farming and processing, and petroleum refining and processing are three of the most disproportionately large industries in Louisiana.Louisiana s June 2015 unemployment rate of 6.4% was higher than that of most states. The state also had a below average year-over-year job growth rate, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by only 0.7% between June 2014 and June 2015.38. AlaskaMining, fishing, and seafood processing are among the most disproportionately large employers in Alaska.While Alaska s $77,477 GDP per capita was the second highest in the country, the state s GDP was one of only two that were lower in 2014 than 2013, with a 1.3% drop in economic activity over the year. The state s unemployment rate of 6.8% was the fourth highest among the states.37. MarylandLike Virginia, Maryland s proximity to Washington means a huge federal presence in the state: 15 of the 20 most over-represented industries in Maryland are federal government employers.While Maryland s $1,113 average weekly wage and $58,335 GDP per capita were both quite high, the state was one of only three to see house prices drop between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, with the house price index dropping 0.38%. This housing market weakness along with middling scores on our other metrics kept the state from rising higher in our rankings.36. PennsylvaniaPennsylvania is home to several storied US corporations, like US Steel, Comcast, Rite Aid, and Hershey. This heritage shows up in the industries that employ a disproportionately large number of workers in the state: about 13,000 Pennsylvanians work in iron and steel mills, and about 8,000 in chocolate candy manufacturing.Pennsylvania was pretty middle of the road on most of our metrics. The state s June 2015 unemployment rate of 5.4% was just above the national rate of 5.3%, and the Q4 2014 average weekly wage of $1,013 was very close to the national average wage of $1,035.35. South CarolinaSouth Carolina has a disproportionately large manufacturing sector. Various types of fabric and textile manufacturing, tire manufacturing, and fabricated metal product manufacturing all employ a higher proportion of South Carolinians than of Americans as a whole.While South Carolina s housing market was strengthening, with a 6.46% increase in housing prices between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, the state s unemployment rate of 6.6% was the sixth highest among the states, and its per capita GDP of just $39,380 was the third lowest.34. IndianaManufacturing is still a big part of Indiana s economy: About 21,000 Hoosiers are employed in motor vehicle power train manufacturing, another 34,000 in auto body manufacturing, and about 20,000 in iron and steel mills.Indiana was a mixed bag on our measures. GDP growth was sluggish at just 0.4% in 2014. On the other hand, average weekly wages grew 3.9% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014, a bit higher than the national rate of 3.5%.33. Rhode IslandRhode Island s coastal location shows up in its economy, with private marinas and shipbuilders among the most disproportionately large employers in the state.Rhode Island s unemployment rate has dropped quite a bit in recent years, but at 5.9% in June, it is still above the 5.3% national rate. Rhode Island s job creation was middle of the road, with nonfarm payrolls growing by 1.2% between June 2014 and June 2015. On a brighter note, the 4.5% rate of year over year wage growth was the fifth highest among the states.32. ConnecticutGeneral Electric, No. 8 on the Fortune 500, calls Connecticut home, as do health insurance giants Aetna and Cigna. Not surprisingly, aerospace manufacture, insurance, and financial activities are among the most disproportionately large employers in the Constitution State.While Connecticut s GDP per capita of $70,353 was the sixth best in the country, and its $1,278 average weekly wage was the fourth best, the state s house price growth of 0.40% was the fourth worst.31. NevadaThe home of Las Vegas naturally has an outsize gaming sector. About 183,000 Nevadans are employed by Casino hotels, with another 10,000 employed by non-hotel casinos and other gambling establishments.Nevada found itself in the middle of the states because of a few extreme scores on our rankings. On the positive side, the state had the second-highest rate of job growth among the states, with nonfarm payrolls growing by 3.5% between June 2014 and June 2015. The state s housing market has been recovering nicely after being slammed especially hard after the collapse of the housing bubble, with housing prices rising 10.11% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, the second-highest jump in the country.On the negative side, Nevada s 6.9% unemployment rate is the third highest in the country, and the state s average weekly wage only grew by 1.6% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014, the second-lowest growth rate among the states.30. OklahomaThe oil industry plays an outsize role in Oklahoma s economy. About 24,000 people work in the oil-and-gas-extraction industry, with another 37,000 in support activities for mining.Like Nevada, Oklahoma scored very well on a few of our metrics and poorly on others. On the positive side, the state s 2014 GDP growth rate was 2.8%, the ninth-best among the states, and the state unemployment rate of 4.5% was much lower than average. On the negative side, job growth was slow, with a 0.6% year-over-year growth rate in nonfarm payroll jobs.29. WisconsinWisconsin s association with cheese and other dairy products is no accident: Some 17,000 Wisconsinites are employed in dairy product manufacturing, 13,000 in dairy cattle and milk production, and another 5,000 in dairy product wholesale.Wisconsin scored close to average on most of our metrics. The state s June 2015 unemployment rate of 4.6% was quite a bit lower than the national rate of 5.3%, housing prices went up 5.09% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, right in line with the national change of 4.96%, and the state s Q4 2013-Q4 2014 wage growth of 3.4% was about the same as the national growth rate of 3.5%.28. MontanaMontana is a big, wide-open state, and cattle ranching is a disproportionately large industry there. Montana s 3.9% unemployment rate was the eighth best among the states, but its average weekly wage of $794 was the fourth lowest.27. KentuckyKentucky is famous for its bourbon, its horse races, and its coal. All three are disproportionately big employers in the state: About 4,000 Kentuckians work in distilleries, 1,300 in horse ranching, and 11,000 in coal mining.Kentucky fell in the middle on most of our metrics. The state saw nonfarm payroll jobs rise by 2.2% between June 2014 and June 2015, close to the national rate of 2.1%. The state s average weekly wage was a bit lower than average, however, at just $836 compared to the national average of $1,035.26. North CarolinaNorth Carolina is home to 27 Fortune 1000 companies, including Duke Energy, Lowe s, and Bank of America.Job growth was healthy in the state, with a 2.4% increase in nonfarm payrolls between June 2014 and June 2015, slightly higher than the 2.1% national growth rate. The state s 2014 GDP per capita of $48,585 was a bit below the national level of $54,307.25. OhioOhio s industrial legacy lives on. About 31,000 Ohioans are employed in motor-vehicle parts manufacturing, with another 11,000 in motor-vehicle metal stamping.Ohio s 2014 2.1% GDP growth was just below the national growth rate of 2.2%, and the state s 5.2% unemployment rate was just below the national 5.3% rate.24. HawaiiHawaii is a gorgeous state, and tourism is a big part of the economy. Hotels employ about 38,000 residents of the state, with another 7,000 employed as tour operators and in sightseeing transportation.Hawaii s unemployment rate of 4.0% was below the national rate of 5.3%, but the state s housing market was more sluggish than average, with home prices rising just 1.53%, lower than the national growth rate of 4.96%.23. DelawareDelaware has an extremely generous corporate law, and over half of US companies are legally incorporated in the state.Delaware had a high 2014 GDP/capita, at $67,075, much higher than the national GDP per capita of $54,307. However, the state s year over year wage growth of just 1.5% was the lowest among the states.22. IowaAgricultural industries are a big part of Iowa s economy. Agricultural equipment manufacturing, starch, and vegetable oil manufacturing, and breakfast-cereal manufacturing are three of the most disproportionately large industries in the state.Iowa s 3.7% unemployment rate was the fifth lowest in the country. The state s 2014 GDP growth of just 0.4% was relatively anemic, however.21. South DakotaSouth Dakota s economy still relies heavily on agriculture. Grain farming and wholesale, livestock wholesale, and cattle production all employ South Dakotans at a higher rate than Americans as a whole.While South Dakota s June 2015 unemployment rate of 3.8% was the sixth lowest in the country, the Q4 2014 average weekly wage was just $791, third lowest among the states.20. TennesseeTennessee is home to 20 members of the Fortune 1000, including shipping giant FedEx, discount retailer Dollar General, and hospital conglomerate HCA.Tennessee scored about average on many of our metrics. The state s unemployment rate of 5.7% was a bit higher than the national 5.3% rate, and the average weekly wage in the state grew by 3.5% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014, equal to the national growth rate.19. VermontCoffee-pod conglomerate Keurig Green Mountain was founded in Vermont, where it has its headquarters.Vermont s 3.6% unemployment rate was the fourth lowest in the country, but the state s 2014 GDP growth was rather sluggish at just 0.6%.18. GeorgiaTextiles are a disproportionately large part of Georgia s economy, with carpet and rug mills, fiber and yarn mills, and fabric mills all employing Georgians at a higher rate than other Americans.Georgia s GDP grew by 2.3% in 2014, slightly higher than the 2.2% national growth rate. The state s unemployment rate of 6.1% continues to be higher than that of most other states.17. Michigan Detroit still looms large in Michigan: About 46,000 residents of Michigan work in auto and light-truck manufacturing, with tens of thousands more in related industries like metal stamping for cars and power train manufacturing.Michigan s housing market has been improving, with home prices rising 6.4% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, somewhat faster than the national increase of 5.0%. The state s 2.2% growth in nonfarm payrolls between June 2014 and June 2015 was right in line with the US rate of 2.1%.16. MinnesotaMinnesota is the headquarters for 25 Fortune 1000 companies, including Target, Best Buy, 2M, and General Mills. All four of those are headquartered in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region.Minnesota s 3.9% unemployment rate was the eighth lowest among the states. The state s 2014 GDP per capita of $57,943 was a little higher than the national per-person economic activity of $54,307.15. IdahoMemory and computer-chip maker Micron Technologies   recently in the news after talk of a buyout by Chinese tech giant Tsinghua Unigroup that could draw the ire of US regulators   is based in Boise, Idaho.Idaho s labor market is looking good, with an unemployment rate of just 4.0% and a 2.6% increase in nonfarm payrolls between June 2014 and June 2015. However, the state s per capita GDP of $39,127 and average weekly wage of $782 were both the second lowest among the states.14. NebraskaAgriculture and meat production are big parts of Nebraska s economy. About 26,000 Nebraskans are employed in animal slaughtering and processing, with thousands more in grain farming, cattle ranching, and agricultural-tool manufacturing.Nebraska s unemployment rate of 2.6% was the lowest in the country in June 2015. The state s average wage rose an impressive 5.2% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014. Despite that increase, the Q4 2014 average weekly wage was just $837, quite a bit lower than the national average of $1,035.13. WyomingOil and coal mining are a big part of Wyoming s economy. About 6,500 citizens of the state work in coal mining, 4,600 in oil and gas drilling, 4,000 in oil- and gas-pipeline construction, and 14,000 in mining-support activities.Wyoming s 2014 GDP growth rate of 5.1% and per capita GDP of $75,648 were both the third highest in the country. However, Wyoming was one of just two states to have fewer people working in the state in June 2015 than in June 2014, with the number of nonfarm payroll jobs in the state dropping by 0.7%.12. FloridaWith Disney World, Sea World, and Universal Studios all located in the Sunshine State, it s not surprising that about 69,000 Floridians are employed in the amusement and theme-park industry.Florida s housing market, one of the worst hit by the collapse of the 2000s housing bubble, has been recovering nicely. House prices went up by 8.7%, the third-fastest growth rate among the states. However, Florida is kept out of the top 10 states with its below average per capita GDP of $42,222.11. CaliforniaThe nation s largest state is home to 10% of the Fortune 1000, with 101 companies on the list having their headquarters in California. These include Silicon Valley giants like Apple, HP, Google, Intel, and Oracle, Disney, and Wells Fargo.While California s 2014 GDP growth of 2.8% was the ninth highest among the states and the house price increase of 7.5% was the fifth highest, the June unemployment rate of 6.3% was the ninth highest, hurting California s overall score.10. OregonAthletic-apparel and shoe giant Nike was founded in Oregon, where it still has its headquarters.Oregon s 3.2% increase in nonfarm payroll jobs between June 2014 and June 2015 was the fifth best in the country, and its 3.6% GDP growth in 2014 was the sixth best.9. New YorkBusiness Insider s Sarah Schmalbruch recently pointed out that New York City is the greatest city in the world, and so it s no surprise that the state economy that includes the financial capital of the US and arguably the world falls in the top 10.New York had the second-highest average weekly wage in the country, at $1,321. The state s GDP per capita of $71,128 was the fifth highest. However, the June unemployment rate of 5.5% remains just above the national rate of 5.3%.8. New HampshireThe industrial legacy of New England lives on in New Hampshire. About 7,300 residents work in electronic-instrument manufacturing, 5,000 in semiconductor and electronic-component manufacturing, and 3,700 in miscellaneous fabricated-metal product manufacturing.New Hampshire s 3.8% unemployment rate was the sixth lowest among the states, and its average weekly wage grew by a very impressive 6.3% from Q4 2013 to Q4 2014, the second highest rate in the country.7. UtahUtah is home to four Fortune 1000 companies, the largest of which is the Huntsman chemical corporation.Utah s job market is booming. The number of nonfarm payrolls in the state grew by 4.3%, the fastest growth rate in the country. Meanwhile, Utah s 3.5% unemployment rate was the third lowest.6. MassachusettsWith its several colleges and universities providing a highly educated workforce, Massachusetts is a major hub of finance and high tech. Big companies like insurer Liberty Mutual, retail giant T.J. Maxx, and defense contractor Raytheon all have their headquarters in the state.Massachusetts  2014 per capita GDP of $68,185 was the seventh best among the states, and the state had the third highest Q4 2014 average weekly wage, at $1,315.5. WashingtonTen Fortune 500 companies are based in Washington, including discount retail giant Costco, ubiquitous coffee chain Starbucks, and huge tech companies Amazon and Microsoft.Washington s housing market is doing quite well: House prices rose 7.6% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, the fourth-highest growth rate among the states. The state s 3.5% increase in nonfarm payrolls between June 2014 and June 2015 was the third best in the country.4. TexasWhile Texas has a very diverse economy, and despite turbulence in prices in the last year, oil remains a big part of the Texas story. About 103,000 Texans are employed in the oil-and-gas-extraction industry, and tens of thousands more are in related industries, like pipeline construction, mining support activities, and petrochemical manufacturing.Texas performed very well on all seven of our measures, ranking no worse than 13th in each. Particularly impressive were the state s second best in the country 2014 GDP growth rate of 5.2% and sixth best housing price increase of 6.5%.3. District of ColumbiaUnsurprisingly, the federal government is the dominant factor in the economy of the nation s capital. About 31% of workers are employed by the federal and local governments in the district.DC is quite different from the states, and it had some extreme scores on our measures. Washington came up as high in the ranking as it did because of its absolutely stunning per capita GDP of $175,253   over three times the US per capita GDP of $54,307. Also greatly helping DC s standing was its equally impressive average weekly wage of $1,696, about $375 higher than second-place New York.On the downside, the district s 7.0% unemployment rate was the second highest in the country, and housing prices fell 0.8% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, a situation that happened in only two states.2. ColoradoDish Network, Western Union, and Chipotle are three of the 23 Fortune 1000 companies headquartered in Colorado.Colorado s housing market had the most improvement in the country, with house prices rising 11.2% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015. The state s 2014 GDP growth rate of 4.7% was also very strong, and was the fifth best among the states.1. North DakotaNorth Dakota had the strongest economy in the country. The state s economy has seen a major boon from the rise of oil fracking in the last few years, and despite chaos in oil prices recently, North Dakota s economy remains robust.North Dakota s 3.1% unemployment rate was the second lowest in the country. The state also had both the highest 2014 GDP growth rate of 6.3% and the highest average wage growth rate of a whopping 7.1%.Via: Business Insider ","how does your state’s economy rank? washington dc’s ranking and #1 state may surprise you thanks to obama s promise to shut down the coal industry, west virginia comes in at #50. it s also interesting to note where washington dc ranks in the nations best economies and why.business insider ranked the economies of these states, and dc s, on seven measures: unemployment rates, gross domestic product per capita, average weekly wages, and recent growth rates for non-farm payroll jobs, gdp, house prices, and wages.while they didn t factor them into the ranking, they also looked at the fortune 1000 companies that have their headquarters in each state and which industries were disproportionately important in each state. this helped us get a little more insight into what makes each state economy tick.for more details on methodology and sources, click here.51. mississippimississippi came in last in our ranking of state economies. chicken, soybean, cotton, and rice farming are among the state s most disproportionately large employers.mississippi had the lowest 2014 gdp per capita of any of the states, at just $35,019, and the lowest q4 2014 weekly wage, at $747. the rate at which both of those measures was changing were also weak: mississippi had the second-lowest gdp growth rate, with state gdp shrinking by 1.2%. the average weekly wage grew just 2.3% between q4 2013 and q4 2014.50. west virginiawest virginia was one of just two states in which fewer people were working in june 2015 than in june 2015, with a drop of 1.2% in nonfarm payrolls over the year. the appalachian state was also one of only three states where housing prices dropped between q1 2014 and q1 2015, and had the biggest drop in the state housing price index, falling 3.90%. one bright spot was that gdp grew by 5.1% in 2014, higher than the national rate of 2.2%.49. alabamaalabama s 2014 per capita gdp of $41,127 was far lower than the us per capita gdp of $54,307. gdp growth was also slower than in other states, increasing just 0.7% in 2014. alabama s housing market remains lackluster, with housing prices rising just 1.8% between q1 2014 and q1 2015.48. new mexiconew mexico has a large mining sector: about 18,000 new mexicans are employed in support activities for mining. the state, home to research institutions like the university of new mexico and the los alamos national laboratory, also has a disproportionately large number of people employed in science, with about 22,000 private sector physics, engineering, and biological-research employees.new mexico s june unemployment rate of 6.4% was a bit higher than the national rate of 5.3%, and its housing market was sluggish, with home prices rising just 1.46% between q1 2014 and q1 2015. one bright spot is wage growth, with the weekly average wage in the state jumping 4.4% between q4 2013 and q4 2014.47. missourimissouri is home to 26 fortune 1000 companies, including emerson electric, agricultural giant monsanto, o reilly automotive, and energizer.missouri had a low rate of employment growth, with nonfarm payrolls growing just 0.8% between june 2014 and june 2015. the state was slightly below average on all our other metrics, like its 5.8% june 2015 unemployment rate, higher than the national rate of 5.3%.46. maineshipbuilding and maintenance jobs are disproportionately common in maine, home to portsmouth naval shipyard, one of the four main shipyards used by the us navy. the federal government employs about 4,700 workers in these industries.maine saw low gdp growth in 2014 of only 0.2%. maine s housing market was also slow, seeing only a 1.07% increase in housing prices. maine s average weekly wage of $826 was also a bit lower than the national average of $1,035.45. arkansaswhile home to corporate giants like walmart, which sits at the very top of the fortune 500 list, and food-processing conglomerate tyson foods, arkansas economy overall is weaker than that of most states.arkansas per capita gdp was $40,924, well below the us gdp per capita of $54,307. similarly, the state s average weekly wage of $807 was quite a bit lower than the us average wage of $1,035 per week. however, the state s wage situation is improving: wages rose by 4.5% from q4 2013 to q4 2014, the fifth highest wage-growth rate among the states.44. new jersey the garden state is home to the headquarters of several large corporations, including johnson & johnson, prudential financial, merck, and honeywell international. although atlantic city has seen better times, about 23,000 new jerseyans are employed at casino hotels, about three times the national rate of employment in this industry.new jersey had some rather extreme scores on our measures. while new jersey s gdp per capita of $61,433 and average weekly wage of $1,211 were among the highest in the country, the growth rates for these two measures were far weaker: gdp grew just 0.4% in 2014, and wages rose just 2.0% between q4 2013 and q4 2014, much lower than the 3.5% change nationwide.43. kansaskansas economy has huge agriculture and aerospace sectors. among the most disproportionately common jobs in kansas are livestock wholesalers, cattle ranchers, turkey producers, and airplane manufacturers.kansas over the year wage growth of 2.6% was somewhat weaker than the national rate of 3.5% between q4 2013 and q4 2014. job growth was also below average, with nonfarm payrolls growing by only 0.8% between june 2014 and june 2015. despite the slow change in employment, kansas june 2015 unemployment rate of 4.5% was quite a bit lower than the national 5.3% rate.42. virginiawith its proximity to the nation s capital and several key military installations, it s not surprising that government and military activities play a disproportionately large role in virginia s economy. about 38,000 virginians are employed in the shipbuilding industry, and 64,000 are employed by the federal government in national-security positions.this heavy government and defense presence also shows up in virginia s fortune 1000 companies: among the big companies headquartered in virginia are the government-backed freddie mac, and defense contractors general dynamics and northrop grumman.virginia s job growth was mediocre and its gdp growth was weaker than most states. nonfarm payroll jobs increased by 1.3% between june 2014 and june 2015, and the state s gdp was flat in 2014, growing 0.0%. a more positive measure for virginia was the state s average weekly wage of $1,057, just above the national average of $1,035.41. illinoisseveral iconic companies call illinois home, like airplane builder boeing, pharmacy giant walgreens, insurance companies state farm and allstate, and the troubled burger sellers of mcdonald s.while illinois weekly average wage of $1,089 is better than that of most other states, wage growth has been slower, with wages rising just 2.8% between q4 2013 and q4 2014.40. arizonaanchored by the metropolis of phoenix, arizona has a diverse economy. among the most disproportionately large industries are mining, professional organizations, financial processing, and electronics manufacturing.arizona s housing market is recovering well, with housing prices rising 6.03% between q1 2014 and q1 2015, a bit faster than the national change of 4.96%. however, the state s gdp per capita is somewhat lower than in other areas, at just $42,213, about $12,000 lower than the us per capita gdp of $54,307.39. louisianashipping services, sugar farming and processing, and petroleum refining and processing are three of the most disproportionately large industries in louisiana.louisiana s june 2015 unemployment rate of 6.4% was higher than that of most states. the state also had a below average year-over-year job growth rate, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by only 0.7% between june 2014 and june 2015.38. alaskamining, fishing, and seafood processing are among the most disproportionately large employers in alaska.while alaska s $77,477 gdp per capita was the second highest in the country, the state s gdp was one of only two that were lower in 2014 than 2013, with a 1.3% drop in economic activity over the year. the state s unemployment rate of 6.8% was the fourth highest among the states.37. marylandlike virginia, maryland s proximity to washington means a huge federal presence in the state: 15 of the 20 most over-represented industries in maryland are federal government employers.while maryland s $1,113 average weekly wage and $58,335 gdp per capita were both quite high, the state was one of only three to see house prices drop between q1 2014 and q1 2015, with the house price index dropping 0.38%. this housing market weakness along with middling scores on our other metrics kept the state from rising higher in our rankings.36. pennsylvaniapennsylvania is home to several storied us corporations, like us steel, comcast, rite aid, and hershey. this heritage shows up in the industries that employ a disproportionately large number of workers in the state: about 13,000 pennsylvanians work in iron and steel mills, and about 8,000 in chocolate candy manufacturing.pennsylvania was pretty middle of the road on most of our metrics. the state s june 2015 unemployment rate of 5.4% was just above the national rate of 5.3%, and the q4 2014 average weekly wage of $1,013 was very close to the national average wage of $1,035.35. south carolinasouth carolina has a disproportionately large manufacturing sector. various types of fabric and textile manufacturing, tire manufacturing, and fabricated metal product manufacturing all employ a higher proportion of south carolinians than of americans as a whole.while south carolina s housing market was strengthening, with a 6.46% increase in housing prices between q1 2014 and q1 2015, the state s unemployment rate of 6.6% was the sixth highest among the states, and its per capita gdp of just $39,380 was the third lowest.34. indianamanufacturing is still a big part of indiana s economy: about 21,000 hoosiers are employed in motor vehicle power train manufacturing, another 34,000 in auto body manufacturing, and about 20,000 in iron and steel mills.indiana was a mixed bag on our measures. gdp growth was sluggish at just 0.4% in 2014. on the other hand, average weekly wages grew 3.9% between q4 2013 and q4 2014, a bit higher than the national rate of 3.5%.33. rhode islandrhode island s coastal location shows up in its economy, with private marinas and shipbuilders among the most disproportionately large employers in the state.rhode island s unemployment rate has dropped quite a bit in recent years, but at 5.9% in june, it is still above the 5.3% national rate. rhode island s job creation was middle of the road, with nonfarm payrolls growing by 1.2% between june 2014 and june 2015. on a brighter note, the 4.5% rate of year over year wage growth was the fifth highest among the states.32. connecticutgeneral electric, no. 8 on the fortune 500, calls connecticut home, as do health insurance giants aetna and cigna. not surprisingly, aerospace manufacture, insurance, and financial activities are among the most disproportionately large employers in the constitution state.while connecticut s gdp per capita of $70,353 was the sixth best in the country, and its $1,278 average weekly wage was the fourth best, the state s house price growth of 0.40% was the fourth worst.31. nevadathe home of las vegas naturally has an outsize gaming sector. about 183,000 nevadans are employed by casino hotels, with another 10,000 employed by non-hotel casinos and other gambling establishments.nevada found itself in the middle of the states because of a few extreme scores on our rankings. on the positive side, the state had the second-highest rate of job growth among the states, with nonfarm payrolls growing by 3.5% between june 2014 and june 2015. the state s housing market has been recovering nicely after being slammed especially hard after the collapse of the housing bubble, with housing prices rising 10.11% between q1 2014 and q1 2015, the second-highest jump in the country.on the negative side, nevada s 6.9% unemployment rate is the third highest in the country, and the state s average weekly wage only grew by 1.6% between q4 2013 and q4 2014, the second-lowest growth rate among the states.30. oklahomathe oil industry plays an outsize role in oklahoma s economy. about 24,000 people work in the oil-and-gas-extraction industry, with another 37,000 in support activities for mining.like nevada, oklahoma scored very well on a few of our metrics and poorly on others. on the positive side, the state s 2014 gdp growth rate was 2.8%, the ninth-best among the states, and the state unemployment rate of 4.5% was much lower than average. on the negative side, job growth was slow, with a 0.6% year-over-year growth rate in nonfarm payroll jobs.29. wisconsinwisconsin s association with cheese and other dairy products is no accident: some 17,000 wisconsinites are employed in dairy product manufacturing, 13,000 in dairy cattle and milk production, and another 5,000 in dairy product wholesale.wisconsin scored close to average on most of our metrics. the state s june 2015 unemployment rate of 4.6% was quite a bit lower than the national rate of 5.3%, housing prices went up 5.09% between q1 2014 and q1 2015, right in line with the national change of 4.96%, and the state s q4 2013-q4 2014 wage growth of 3.4% was about the same as the national growth rate of 3.5%.28. montanamontana is a big, wide-open state, and cattle ranching is a disproportionately large industry there. montana s 3.9% unemployment rate was the eighth best among the states, but its average weekly wage of $794 was the fourth lowest.27. kentuckykentucky is famous for its bourbon, its horse races, and its coal. all three are disproportionately big employers in the state: about

,fake_true, The Donald Trump Campaign Is Getting Out The Vote – For Democrats,"Now that Donald Trump has more or less sealed the Republican nomination, Democrats see a very real possibility that he could be president and that is scaring people to death. Thanks to Trump, last minute Democratic voter registrations in California are up   way up.In the first three months of the year, California added 1.5 million new voters through the end of April   double the number of new voters added during the same time period in 2012. And the total number of registered Democrats increased by nearly 100,000 people between the beginning of January and the beginning of April   compared to a gain of just 15,000 registered Republicans, according to an analysis from Political Data Inc., a California-based voting analytics firm. What s interesting is that the upticks have been greatest among Democrats and Latinos on those days where Donald Trump is kind of dominating the conversation,  said Mitchell, a former Democratic consultant who has analyzed California voter registration from day to day and by party affiliation since January.Source: PoliticoOf course, this is bluer than blue California. Trump won t win the Golden State, but the state is heavily Latino, and that could mean a lot for the general election in November. In fact, it reflects a pattern that s been happening throughout the primaries.While Republican turnout is at an all time high, Democrats have been almost as busy:Turnout has nearly been just as intense on the Democratic side, where 11.7 percent of eligible voters have cast their ballots, the highest percentage since 1992 other than the year Barack Obama was first elected president in 2008.Several media outlets have recently reported large swaths of legal Hispanic citizens are registering to vote in swing states across the country with the express purpose of casting their ballots against the unapologetic Trump. The outspoken New York real estate magnate launched his campaign by deriding Mexican immigrants as killers and rapists. We ve seen more people this year that want to become citizens and specifically because they want to vote against Trump,  said Mi Familia Vota executive director Ben Monterroso, whose group is among those leading a nationwide effort aimed at getting more Latinos to the polls.Source: Latin PostThe Latino vote represents more than 1/6 of the entire voting populace. Latinos are also the fastest growing demographic in the country. Even before Trump called all Mexicans  rapists  or blathered on about his  big, beautiful wall,  that he would have Mexico pay for, the Republican Party has been on the losing end of the electoral sea change. The last time a Republican wont the majority of the Latino vote was in 2004, and that was George W. Bush, who spoke Span(gl)ish and said he d prioritize comprehensive immigration reform. Yes, George W. Bush was a disastrous president, but his immigration stance was still much better than Trump s.The reality is, that without the Latino vote (yes, he did win the Latino vote in Nevada, but only the very small Republican Latino vote. The vast majority of Nevada Latinos are Democrats), Trump has a very tough road ahead of him: There is no president that can get the White House without having the Latino vote,  Mr. Monterroso told the Latin Post.  You have key states that without the Latino support, the candidate is not going to win, and if those key states don t vote for the president   they re not going to make it. The data backs him up. By most political scientists  estimates, the eventual Republican nominee needs between 40 and 47 percent of the Latino vote to win in a general election.Still, there is a chance Trump could find an issue that appeals to enough Latinos that he could siphon off a few votes from the Democratic nominee. It s doubtful he ll win the Latino vote anywhere, but he doesn t have to win it. He needs about 40 percent of the Latino vote. Is that possible? Well, Romney received 23 percent in 2012 and he wasn t anywhere near as divisive. If California, and the primary so far, are any indication, things look good for the Democratic nominee, assuming the party isn t too divided.Featured image via David McNew at Getty Images.

That s 1 in every 7 US citizens using food stamps!

MEDIA Caught Red-Handed Trying To Demoralize Trump Supporters With Phony Polls,"In their desire to push Hillary Clinton across the finish line, the mainstream media and RINO pundits continue to ignore that one little important factoid; like the massive turnout for Trump in almost every state during the primaries. They also intentionally ignore the parallels between Ronald Reagan and Donald J. Trump going into the general election. Most Americans however, are unaware of the tricks our media plays so it s up to us to make sure we share these facts and inform friends, family, neighbors and co-workers about the truth. A new Reuters poll has many Republicans worried about the outcome of the 2016 presidential race and many on the Democratic side ready to pop the champaign corks.The poll shows presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leading by a shocking 14 percent over her Republican rival Donald Trump: 47 percent to 33 percent.Unfortunately there s one problem with the poll. It is heavily skewed.The Gateway Pundit reports that of Reuters  1,201 respondents, 626 were Democrats and only 423 were Republicans.In other words, 52 percent of Reuter s respondents were Democrats and only 35 percent were Republican a huge 33% advantage for Democrats!According to AllenBWest.com, Reuters isn t the only misleading presidential poll. A new ABC News/ Washington Post survey found voters preferred Hillary 51 percent to 39 percent. In that sample, 36 percent of respondents were Democrats and only 24 percent were Republicans.The skewed polls are made less believable by the fact that Republican turnout in 2016 is likely to be higher than in previous years. As NPR noted in March, Republicans far outstripped Democrats in primary turnout, due in part to the insurgent nature of the Donald Trump candidacy.

Ronald Reagan was down 15 points in the polls in March. Here is the map showing how many states he won in the general election compared to Jimmy Carter who was polling at 15 points ahead of Trump:The CSMonitor reported, via Free Republic:The nation s Republicans are working against the clock to answer two key questions: Can conservative Ronald Reagan possibly attract enough independent and Democratic votes to win in November?An if he is likely to lose, has former President Gerald Ford time enough to challenge him for the GOP nomination?The consensus among political experts is that time has probably already run out for Gerald Ford, though he still appears the stronger choice to beat Jimmy Carter in November.But some experts caution: Don t count Ronald Reagan out as a national candidate for the fall. He is not, they say,  a McGovern or a Goldwater    fringe candidates who led their parties to one-sided defeats in 1972 and 1964. Intellectuals don t want to take him seriously, but he does well with working-class voters. He would take the West, challenge President Carter in the South, and do well in the pivotal Midwest states like Ohio and Illinois, whose southern regions titled toward Carter in 1976, they say.Back in March 1980 the establishment the establishment said the same thing about Ronald Reagan.They said he could never defeat Jimmy Carter.He was too divisive.  Gateway PunditHere are a few inconvenient facts you won t see in the mainstream media:The Republican Party started the year with 17 bona fide candidates for President. This was more candidates than any major party in history.Trump has more wins than any other Republican or Democrat candidate in this year s race with 36. He also has more primary wins with 33 and leads all candidates in percent of overall wins and in percent of primary wins.Trump surpassed the number of delegates needed to win the Republican nomination for President a couple weeks ago.This may be more delegates than any other Republican candidate and a higher percentage of delegates than any Republican or Democrat candidate in the race.Trump received 13,406,108 votes to date in the elections according to www.thegreenpapers.com.As a result Trump has more votes than any candidate in Republican history.Trump shattered the previous record by 1.4 million votes   and that was with 17 candidates in the raceGeorge W.

A new ABC News/ Washington Post survey found voters preferred Hillary 51 percent to 39 percent. In that sample, 36 percent of respondents were Democrats and only 24 percent were Republicans.The skewed polls are made less believable by the fact that Republican turnout in 2016 is likely to be higher than in previous years. As NPR noted in March, Republicans far outstripped Democrats in primary turnout, due in part to the insurgent nature of the Donald Trump candidacy.  Hannity.comIt s not just the leftist media who is beating the drum of doom for Trump, while (falsely) pushing the narrative that he can t beat Crooked Hillary in the general election.  FLASHBACK: You hear the establishment types talk about it nearly every day on the FOX News Channel.For his part, Donald Trump says he has not  even started  on Hillary Clinton.The elites also worried about Ronald Reagan s chances back in March 1980. Ronald Reagan was down 15 points in the polls in March. Here is the map showing how many states he won in the general election compared to Jimmy Carter who was polling at 15 points ahead of Trump:The CSMonitor reported, via Free Republic:The nation s Republicans are working against the clock to answer two key questions: Can conservative Ronald Reagan possibly attract enough independent and Democratic votes to win in November?An if he is likely to lose, has former President Gerald Ford time enough to challenge him for the GOP nomination?The consensus among political experts is that time has probably already run out for Gerald Ford, though he still appears the stronger choice to beat Jimmy Carter in November.But some experts caution: Don t count Ronald Reagan out as a national candidate for the fall. He is not, they say,  a McGovern or a Goldwater    fringe candidates who led their parties to one-sided defeats in 1972 and 1964. Intellectuals don t want to take him seriously, but he does well with working-class voters. He would take the West, challenge President Carter in the South, and do well in the pivotal Midwest states like Ohio and Illinois, whose southern regions titled toward Carter in 1976, they say.Back in March 1980 the establishment the establishment said the same thing about Ronald Reagan.They said he could never defeat Jimmy Carter.He was too divisive.  Gateway PunditHere are a few inconvenient facts you won t see in the mainstream media:The Republican Party started the year with 17 bona fide candidates for President. This was more candidates than any major party in history.Trump has more wins than any other Republican or Democrat candidate in this year s race with 36. He also has more primary wins with 33 and leads all candidates in percent of overall wins and in percent of primary wins.Trump surpassed the number of delegates needed to win the Republican nomination for President a couple weeks ago.This may be more delegates than any other Republican candidate and a higher percentage of delegates than any Republican or Democrat candidate in the race.Trump received 13,406,108 votes to date in the elections according to www.thegreenpapers.com.As a result Trump has more votes than any candidate in Republican history.Trump shattered the previous record by 1.4 million votes   and that was with 17 candidates in the raceGeorge W. Bush had 12 million votes in 2000. The Republican Party also set a party record this year in pre-convention state election turnout with over 28 million votes to date which is 139% of the record high voter turnout in 2008. This increase in votes can be attributed to Donald Trump.Via: Gateway Pundit ","busted! media caught red-handed trying to demoralize trump supporters with phony polls in their desire to push hillary clinton across the finish line, the mainstream media and rino pundits continue to ignore that one little important factoid;

,fake_true,THINK AMERICA CAN’T END UP LIKE GREECE? THINK AGAIN!," The United States government has been living beyond its means, running up an enormous debt that will eventually need to be repaid. Most Americans look at the rerun of the Greek euro crisis with something between smug amusement and condescending disapproval. When will those profligate Greeks get their economic house in order and stop looking to others to bail them out? But, should people living in glass economic houses really throw stones? After all, just like Greece, the United States government has been living beyond its means, running up an enormous debt that will eventually need to be repaid. True, our budget deficit this year will be lower than it has been, just $486 billion compared to $1.4 trillion as recently as 2009. But this is just a temporary respite. Within the next couple of years the deficit will start to rise again. By 2025, we will again face trillion-dollar shortfalls. And even a $486 billion deficit adds to our ever growing debt. Our national debt currently approaches $18.2 trillion, roughly 101% of GDP. That s right. We owe more than the value of all the goods and services produced in this country every year. It is as if your credit-card bills exceeded your entire pay check. That s not quite as bad as Greece, of course, whose debt exceeds 177% of their GDP. But it is worse than countries like France or Spain.  And give us time! Like Greece, the driving force behind our debt is the growing cost of entitlement programs for health care and retirement. If one includes future unfunded liabilities for Social Security and Medicare, our real debt exceeds $90 trillion. That s more than five times our GDP. Greece is still in worse shape   their unfunded liabilities top 875% of GDP   but we re gaining. At the heart of Greece s problems lies a government grown too big, too intrusive, and too expensive. The Greek government spent nearly half of the country s GDP last year (49.3%), and that actually represents a decline from the 51.8% it averaged since 2006. The Greek s may complain about austerity, but they ve hardly practiced it. Our government is far smaller than Greece s today. Federal spending is just 20.5% of GDP. But, according to the Congressional Budget Office s alternative fiscal scenario, that could rise to almost 34% by mid-century. Factoring in state and local government spending, which already accounts for roughly 14.4% of GDP, total government expenditure in the US could reach 48% to 50% in 2050, roughly Greek levels. As government grows, the private sector contracts. Greece has one of the most inhospitable business climates in Europe, ranking 84th in the world in the most recent Economic Freedom of the World Index. Meanwhile, as the United States continues to increase taxes and regulations, we have fallen from the second highest economic freedom ranking just 15 years ago to 12th place. Of course, the United States has some advantages that the Greeks lack. Greece owes a significant share of its debt to foreign governments, while the majority of American debt is domestically held. The United States also faces low borrowing rates, while Greece has been effectively shut out of capital markets. The US debt may be bad, but in many ways we are the fastest horse in the glue factory. As long as the euro remains in crisis, we will continue to be able to borrow money at absurdly low interest rates. The United States also controls its own currency and monetary policy, while Greece is hostage to the European Central Bank, which must balance its interest against those of other countries in the monetary union, many of which are in far different economic positions.The danger for the United States is that spending on entitlements will surge in the coming decades, which means that, absent reform, they take over the economy. Investors would respond to the weaker economic outlook by demanding higher returns in order to continue investing in US bonds, which would further drive up interest costs, making our problems even worse. And, of course, unlike Greece, there aren t other countries or organizations available to bail us out.Read more: NYP","think america can’t end up like greece? think again! the united states government has been living beyond its means, running up an enormous debt that will eventually need to be repaid. most americans look at the rerun of the greek euro crisis with something between smug amusement and condescending disapproval. when will those profligate greeks get their economic house in order and stop looking to others to bail them out? but, should people living in glass economic houses really throw stones? after all, just like greece, the united states government has been living beyond its means, running up an enormous debt that will eventually need to be repaid. true, our budget deficit this year will be lower than it has been, just $486 billion compared to $1.4 trillion as recently as 2009. but this is just a temporary respite. within the next couple of years the deficit will start to rise again. by 2025, we will again face trillion-dollar shortfalls. and even a $486 billion deficit adds to our ever growing debt. our national debt currently approaches $18.2 trillion, roughly 101% of gdp. that s right. we owe more than the value of all the goods and services produced in this country every year. it is as if your credit-card bills exceeded your entire pay check. that s not quite as bad as greece, of course, whose debt exceeds 177% of their gdp. but it is worse than countries like france or spain. and give us time! like greece, the driving force behind our debt is the growing cost of entitlement programs for health care and retirement. if one includes future unfunded liabilities for social security and medicare, our real debt exceeds $90 trillion. that s more than five times our gdp. greece is still in worse shape their unfunded liabilities top 875% of gdp but we re gaining. at the heart of greece s problems lies a government grown too big, too intrusive, and too expensive. the greek government spent nearly half of the country s gdp last year (49.3%), and that actually represents a decline from the 51.8% it averaged since 2006. the greek s may complain about austerity, but they ve hardly practiced it. our government is far smaller than greece s today. federal spending is just 20.5% of gdp. but, according to the congressional budget office s alternative fiscal scenario, that could rise to almost 34% by mid-century. factoring in state and local government spending, which already accounts for roughly 14.4% of gdp, total government expenditure in the us could reach 48% to 50% in 2050, roughly greek levels. as government grows, the private sector contracts. greece has one of the most inhospitable business climates in europe, ranking 84th in the world in the most recent economic freedom of the world index. meanwhile, as the united states continues to increase taxes and regulations, we have fallen from the second highest economic freedom ranking just 15 years ago to 12th place. of course, the united states has some advantages that the greeks lack. greece owes a significant share of its debt to foreign governments, while the majority of american debt is domestically held. the united states also faces low borrowing rates, while greece has been effectively shut out of capital markets. the us debt may be bad, but in many ways we are the fastest horse in the glue factory. as long as the euro remains in crisis, we will continue to be able to borrow money at absurdly low interest rates. the united states also controls its own currency and monetary policy, while greece is hostage to the european central bank, which must balance its interest against those of other countries in the monetary union, many of which are in far different economic positions.the danger for the united states is that spending on entitlements will surge in the coming decades, which means that, absent reform, they take over the economy. investors would respond to the weaker economic outlook by demanding higher returns in order to continue investing in us bonds, which would further drive up interest costs, making our problems even worse. and, of course, unlike greece, there aren t other countries or organizations available to bail us out.read more: nyp",0,1,0.8619023814707959,0.3619023814707959,false_positive
,fake_true,HEY HILLARY…Who Are You Going To Blame For The 18 Cities In Pennsylvania With Higher Lead Levels Than Flint?,"Does anyone believe for one second that Hillary or Bernie give a damn about the citizens of Flint, MI? This water issue is nothing more than a campaign tool for Hillary and Bernie, used to prove how much they care for the majority black community of Flint. It s also a great way to pin the blame on MI Republican Governor, Rick Snyder. For anyone who s keeping score, Allentown, PA has the highest recorded elevated lead level in the state, at 23.11% higher than the rest of the state, compared to Flint, Michigan s 3.21%. Allentown, PA has a Democrat mayor, Ed Pawlowski, who has something in common with Hillary, he s under investigation by the FBI. As a side note, a Republican has not held a seat on Allentown city council since 2006. Pennsylvania s govenror, Tom Wolf is also a Democrat.The lead poisoning crisis in Flint, Michigan, was a surprise, an emergency that occurred after the city switched to a new, cheaper water source.But there are at least six cities in the United States where we should, in theory, have really good data on lead exposure. In fiscal year 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent almost $2 million as part of a three-year funding commitment to help some of the biggest cities in the country monitor lead exposure.I spent the past week looking at these cities, and came away with three main findings. The first is that the rate of lead exposure in Pennsylvania is incredibly alarming. Nearly 10 percent of the more than 140,000 kids tested had levels of 5 or more micrograms per deciliter of lead in the blood (5  g/dL)   this is the threshold the government uses to identify children with dangerously elevated blood lead levels. One percent tested positive for blood lead levels greater than 10  g/dL.Compare that to Flint, where state data shows the rate of lead exposure for 5  g/dL from 2014 to 2015 as 3.21 percent. Other researchers have found that specific areas of the city have exposure rates as high as 6.3 percent. That s alarming, but still a lower rate than 18 of the 20 cities in Pennsylvania.While there is strong reason to believe that the increased lead exposure rates in Flint are related to the change in Flint s water source to the Flint River in April 2014, it is important to note that the lead exposure rates in Pennsylvania are largely linked to aging, deteriorating lead-based paint (chips and dust).Second, there are cities that have made really good strides in reducing lead exposure; both Chicago and New York are prime examples.Third, even some of these cities that get money for the express purpose of monitoring lead exposure do not make finding the data easy.Vox reached out to the six cities currently receiving funding from the CDC   Houston, Texas, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, and New York City. Of the six cities, only two were able to provide lead exposure data at the neighborhood level. The other four are getting money to monitor lead exposure   but aren t making the results easily accessible to the public.Philadelphia was not able to share community-area lead level exposure rates, but a 2014 Pennsylvania Department of Health annual report that included detailed information on 20 cities showed that 17 of those had a higher percentage of children with blood lead levels (BLLs)   5  g/dL than the rest of the state.Cities like Allentown and Altoona had more than double the state exposure rate of 9.37 percent, and the group of 20 cities had a collective rate of 11.49 percent, also higher than the state rate. The geometric mean of blood lead level tests performed in Pennsylvania was 2.3  g/dL, which is substantially lower than the state s rate, indicating some cities in Pennsylvania are disproportionately impacted by lead exposure.

Other researchers have found that specific areas of the city have exposure rates as high as 6.3 percent. That s alarming, but still a lower rate than 18 of the 20 cities in Pennsylvania.While there is strong reason to believe that the increased lead exposure rates in Flint are related to the change in Flint s water source to the Flint River in April 2014, it is important to note that the lead exposure rates in Pennsylvania are largely linked to aging, deteriorating lead-based paint (chips and dust).Second, there are cities that have made really good strides in reducing lead exposure; both Chicago and New York are prime examples.Third, even some of these cities that get money for the express purpose of monitoring lead exposure do not make finding the data easy.Vox reached out to the six cities currently receiving funding from the CDC   Houston, Texas, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, and New York City. Of the six cities, only two were able to provide lead exposure data at the neighborhood level. The other four are getting money to monitor lead exposure   but aren t making the results easily accessible to the public.Philadelphia was not able to share community-area lead level exposure rates, but a 2014 Pennsylvania Department of Health annual report that included detailed information on 20 cities showed that 17 of those had a higher percentage of children with blood lead levels (BLLs)   5  g/dL than the rest of the state.Cities like Allentown and Altoona had more than double the state exposure rate of 9.37 percent, and the group of 20 cities had a collective rate of 11.49 percent, also higher than the state rate. The geometric mean of blood lead level tests performed in Pennsylvania was 2.3  g/dL, which is substantially lower than the state s rate, indicating some cities in Pennsylvania are disproportionately impacted by lead exposure. Via: Vox ","hey hillary...who are you going to blame for the 18 cities in pennsylvania with higher lead levels than flint? does anyone believe for one second that hillary or bernie give a damn about the citizens of flint, mi? this water issue is nothing more than a campaign tool for hillary and bernie, used to prove how much they care for the majority black community of flint. it s also a great way to pin the blame on mi republican governor, rick snyder. for anyone who s keeping score, allentown, pa has the highest recorded elevated lead level in the state, at 23.11% higher than the rest of the state, compared to flint, michigan s 3.21%. allentown, pa has a democrat mayor, ed pawlowski, who has something in common with hillary, he s under investigation by the fbi. as a side note, a republican has not held a seat on allentown city council since 2006. pennsylvania s govenror, tom wolf is also a democrat.the lead poisoning crisis in flint, michigan, was a surprise, an emergency that occurred after the city switched to a new, cheaper water source.but there are at least six cities in the united states where we should, in theory, have really good data on lead exposure. in fiscal year 2014, the centers for disease control and prevention spent almost $2 million as part of a three-year funding commitment to help some of the biggest cities in the country monitor lead exposure.i spent the past week looking at these cities, and came away with three main findings. the first is that the rate of lead exposure in pennsylvania is incredibly alarming. nearly 10 percent of the more than 140,000 kids tested had levels of 5 or more micrograms per deciliter of lead in the blood (5 g/dl) this is the threshold the government uses to identify children with dangerously elevated blood lead levels. one percent tested positive for blood lead levels greater than 10 g/dl.compare that to flint, where state data shows the rate of lead exposure for 5 g/dl from 2014 to 2015 as 3.21 percent. other researchers have found that specific areas of the city have exposure rates as high as 6.3 percent. that s alarming, but still a lower rate than 18 of the 20 cities in pennsylvania.while there is strong reason to believe that the increased lead exposure rates in flint are related to the change in flint s water source to the flint river in april 2014, it is important to note that the lead exposure rates in pennsylvania are largely linked to aging, deteriorating lead-based paint (chips and dust).second, there are cities that have made really good strides in reducing lead exposure; both chicago and new york are prime examples.third, even some of these cities that get money for the express purpose of monitoring lead exposure do not make finding the data easy.vox reached out to the six cities currently receiving funding from the cdc houston, texas, philadelphia, los angeles, washington, dc, chicago, and new york city. of the six cities, only two were able to provide lead exposure data at the neighborhood level. the other four are getting money to monitor lead exposure but aren t making the results easily accessible to the public.philadelphia was not able to share community-area lead level exposure rates, but a 2014 pennsylvania department of health annual report that included detailed information on 20 cities showed that 17 of those had a higher percentage of children with blood lead levels (blls) 5 g/dl than the rest of the state.cities like allentown and altoona had more than double the state exposure rate of 9.37 percent, and the group of 20 cities had a collective rate of 11.49 percent, also higher than the state rate. the geometric mean of blood lead level tests performed in pennsylvania was 2.3 g/dl, which is substantially lower than the state s rate, indicating some cities in pennsylvania are disproportionately impacted by lead exposure. via: vox",0,1,0.8589851852449816,0.3589851852449816,false_positive

,fake_true,IMMIGRANT Ghanaian Woman Pleads Guilty To $3.6 Million in Food Stamp Fraud…Media Ignores Her Immigrant Status,"How many more are out there doing the same thing as Vida? If we ever needed a wake up call that this SNAP program is out of control this is it! This is your money but it gets worse Though Causey s massive fraud was noted none of the media reports mentioned her immigrant status.* In 1980 the U.S. had 10,000 immigrants from Ghana and by 2000 we had 235,000 immigrants from Ghana.She was more than forthcoming about it in an interview in 2007 that described her as a Ghanian native.At Ghana Celebrities.com they had this to say about Causey:Trust certain Ghanaians to take their  shenaniganism  to the backyards of whoever opens his country for them and while at it, they are sure to make global headlines with their  get rich schemes.  A Ghanaian based in Worcester, USA has pleaded guilty to $3.6 million fraud after she was busted for screwing the United States food stamp benefit system, which is to help support people of low income.She attended Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana from 1991-1994, according to her LinkedIn page. She enrolled in Quinsigamond Community College between 2003-2005 in Worcester where she studied electronics.In 2011 her community college bragged about her and called her a  success story. CONVENIENCE STORE FRAUDSTER TAKES $3.6 MILLION FROM THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERSConvenience store owner Vida Ofori Causey out of Worcester, Mass. was charged in federal court Monday after pleading guilty to $3.6 million worth of food stamp fraud.According to authorities, Causey abused the program between 2010 and 2014. Food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), is run by local and federal agencies. It is overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). She was able to scam the program by buying food stamp benefits from receipts for half the actual value. Causey purchased the benefits at a discounted value of approximately fifty cents for every SNAP dollar,  a press release from Department of Justice stated.  By so doing, Causey caused the USDA to electronically deposit into a bank account controlled by her the full face value of the SNAP benefits fraudulently obtained. As a result, recipients had cash on hand to buy restricted items. The restricted items could include alcohol, cigarettes and even drugs. The program is supposed to be used to provide food to low-come individuals and families. In total, Causey defrauded the USDA for approximately $3,638,900.SNAP is the nation s largest food-assistance program. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the program has increased from 17 million participants in 2000 to nearly 47 million in 2014.JUST A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON IMMIGATION FROM GHANA TO WORCESTER, MASS:The demographics of the City of Worcester underwent a considerable change between 2000 and 2010, according to a new report from the Worcester Regional Research Bureau. In  Worcester s Demographic Trends: 2010 Census,  the Research Bureau found that the city s African American population increased by 77 percent during the first decade of the 21st Century. During the same period, the Latino population grew by 45 percent and the Asian population grew by 31 percent as well.Meanwhile, the number of residents identifying as white decreased by more than 5 percent, even as the city s overall population grew by almost 5 percent to 181,045.Since bottoming out in 1980, Worcester s population has grown by nearly 20,000 residents, an increase of almost 12 percent over three decades.Surprising Demographic Shifts I think the most surprising was where people are coming from,  said Roberta Schaefer, president and CEO of the Research Bureau.As of the 2010 Census, 3,401 residents, or 9.63 percent of the city s foreign-born population, immigrated from Brazil, earning the South American country the top spot on the list.With 3,356 foreign-born residents, or 9.51 percent of the immigrant population, originating from Vietnam, the country came in a close second.

,fake_true, Donald Trump’s Claim That He’s The Strongest GOP Candidate Ever Is Bulls*it,"Donald Trump loves to brag that he is the strongest Republican candidate ever. As proof, he offers the fact that he received 13 million votes during the primary. Reagan, Trump says, had fewer than 8 million votes. He also bypassed Romney by about three million.Here s what Trump says about it: Look, you know the Republican Party has largely come together. They agree with me, and they believe in me, and I got more votes than anybody in the history of primary elections,  Trump replied.  Nobody s ever even gotten close, the Republicans. I got more than Ronald Reagan, I got more than Richard Nixon, I got more than Dwight Eisenhower, I got more than anybody But I have to say, the Republicans better get smart, they better start sticking together.  Source: Breitbart.comTrump s claim is absolutely true. Do you feel that? That s a collective chill going down the spines of every sane person on the planet. Fortunately for all of sanity, it s not as simple as Trump or some in the media claim. Trump did not bypass Ronald Reagan or even Mitt Romney in the popular vote, and here s why: In the simplest of terms, we have a lot more people than we did when Reagan ran in 1980 and even when Romney ran in 2012.The truth doesn t bode well for Trump:In 1980, Ronald Reagan won 7.7 million votes in the Republican contests in a country that had more than 80 million fewer people of voting age. Further, more than a dozen states held non-binding caucuses that the candidates largely ignored. Adjusting for the population increase and the number of meaningful primary contests today, Reagan likely would have won close to 14 million votes   significantly more than Trump received, according to a HuffPost analysis.Adjusting George W. Bush s 12 million votes from 2000 the same way suggests he might have won 14.5 million votes. And adjusting 1952 s numbers, Eisenhower might have received 13.6 million votes, while Taft might have won 18.6 million   both more than Trump received.But the biggest GOP winner in modern times, according to the HuffPost analysis, was Richard Nixon in 1960, when the sitting vice president won 5 million votes in just 13 contests   suggesting Nixon could have won 25.6 million votes with today s voting population and primary schedule.Source: Huffington PostLet s compare that to Hillary Clinton. In 2008, both she and Barack Obama nearly tied with more than 17 million votes each. This year, her vote totals are lower (about 16 million) but they are still greater than Donald Trump s.Of course, like most of Trump s boasts, these numbers mean absolutely nothing.

,fake_true, Here’s Why A Homeless Man Refused To Come Down From A Giant Tree (VIDEO),"On March 22, Cody Lee Miller, a homeless man who calls the streets of Seattle, Washington his residence, climbed to the top of an eighty-foot tree.Over the next 25 hours, the city of Seattle watched anxiously as Miller refused all attempts by authorities to coax him down from his perch at the top of the giant conifer.People snapped pictures and took cell phone video, posting to Twitter under the hashtag #manintree.The Seattle Times, Washington Post, Detroit News, USA Today and other media outlets around the country covered the story as it unfolded.Image credit: @VixenRogue via TwitterAt various times Miller threw pine cones and tree branches at rescue workers, as they attempted to coax him down.Watch the video from USA Today on YouTube below.At other times, his behavior seemed even more reckless.Image credit: RT America via Twitter.Toward the end of the day, he built a makeshift bed among the branches where he apparently fell asleep for the night. Image credit: Seattle Times via TwitterMore than a day later, a crowd of onlookers cheered as he finally made his way back to the ground below.Here s video of Miller finally coming down from the tree, courtesy of USA Today on youtube.Once he was safe on the ground, Miller was taken to Harborview Medical Center where he underwent a psychiatric examination. He was then taken to jail, where he was booked on charges of criminal mischief.What prompted Miller to climb the tree in the first place?Aside from obvious mental health issues, KOMO reports that three days before Miller was taken into police custody for the crime of  sitting on the sidewalk  near a Starbucks on East Pike Street.His criminal record suggests it was not the first time he d been arrested for the crime of having nowhere to go. He was arrested more than once in Oregon. The charges included things like criminal mischief, obstructing an officer and disorderly conduct, charges often used by police to criminalize homelessness.If you can t sit or stand on the sidewalk, if you can t sleep on a park bench or in some other public space, where can you go?Maybe you d try to climb a tree, hoping that it would allow you some space to just exist.Of course that s not how it played out in Miller s case. Climbing that tree just brought him all kinds of negative attention.Some, including the police, turned this sad situation into a series of bad jokes.Not everyone missed the seriousness of the situation, though.Many Twitter users posted about the need to improve services for people with mental health issues, as well as for those who are homeless.As KOMO reports, at least one person in the crowd was deeply concerned about the situation.Janice Wilson, who was in town from Crescent City, California, to help her son deal with his mental health and legal troubles, said she was once homeless herself, 30 years ago.She repeatedly shouted up to the man:  We love you!

As of November 2015, there were more than 565,000 homeless people in the United States.The city of Seattle is just one of many American cities that declared a state of emergency in 2015, due to the number of homeless people who reside there.While the number of homeless people in Seattle is on the decline, thanks to an increase in wages in the city, for people with physical and mental disabilities, getting a job and  pulling yourself up by your bootstraps  isn t always the answer.With proper treatment the majority of people who experience mental illness do lead normal, productive lives once the condition is treated. But a lack of funding for mental health services all across the country leaves too many people without access to that treatment.According to New York Daily News, Miller refused to leave his jail cell to attend a hearing today.Instead of getting the mental health treatment he obviously needs, it s looking like he will be criminally charged and incarcerated, along with thousands of other mentally ill people in the United States.Featured image via video screen capture KOMO  ","here’s why a homeless man refused to come down from a giant tree (video) on march 22, cody lee miller, a homeless man who calls the streets of seattle, washington his residence, climbed to the top of an eighty-foot tree.over the next 25 hours, the city of seattle watched anxiously as miller refused all attempts by authorities to coax him down from his perch at the top of the giant conifer.people snapped pictures and took cell phone video, posting to twitter under the hashtag #manintree.the seattle times, washington post, detroit news, usa today and other media outlets around the country covered the story as it unfolded.image credit: @vixenrogue via twitterat various times miller threw pine cones and tree branches at rescue workers, as they attempted to coax him down.watch the video from usa today on youtube below.at other times, his behavior seemed even more reckless.image credit: rt america via twitter.toward the end of the day, he built a makeshift bed among the branches where he apparently fell asleep for the night. image credit: seattle times via twittermore than a day later, a crowd of onlookers cheered as he finally made his way back to the ground below.here s video of miller finally coming down from the tree, courtesy of usa today on youtube.once he was safe on the ground, miller was taken to harborview medical center where he underwent a psychiatric examination. he was then taken to jail, where he was booked on charges of criminal mischief.what prompted miller to climb the tree in the first place?aside from obvious mental health issues, komo reports that three days before miller was taken into police custody for the crime of sitting on the sidewalk near a starbucks on east pike street.his criminal record suggests it was not the first time he d been arrested for the crime of having nowhere to go. he was arrested more than once in oregon. the charges included things like criminal mischief, obstructing an officer and disorderly conduct, charges often used by police to criminalize homelessness.if you can t sit or stand on the sidewalk, if you can t sleep on a park bench or in some other public space, where can you go?maybe you d try to climb a tree, hoping that it would allow you some space to just exist.of course that s not how it played out in miller s case. climbing that tree just brought him all kinds of negative attention.some, including the police, turned this sad situation into a series of bad jokes.not everyone missed the seriousness of the situation, though.many twitter users posted about the need to improve services for people with mental health issues, as well as for those who are homeless.as komo reports, at least one person in the crowd was deeply concerned about the situation.janice wilson, who was in town from crescent city, california, to help her son deal with his mental health and legal troubles, said she was once homeless herself, 30 years ago.she repeatedly shouted up to the man: we love you! come down safely! i heard people out here laughing, she said. if somebody s in crisis to the point of putting himself at risk of suicide, what s to laugh about? as of november 2015, there were more than 565,000 homeless people in the united states.the city of seattle is just one of many american cities that declared a state of emergency in 2015, due to the number of homeless people who reside there.while the number of homeless people in seattle is on the decline, thanks to an increase in wages in the city, for people with physical and mental disabilities, getting a job and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps isn t always the answer.with proper treatment the majority of people who experience mental illness do lead normal, productive lives once the condition is treated. but a lack of funding for mental health services all across the country leaves too many people without access to that treatment.according to new york daily news, miller refused to leave his jail cell to attend a hearing today.instead of getting the mental health treatment he obviously needs, it s looking like he will be criminally charged and incarcerated, along with thousands of other mentally ill people in the united states.featured image via video screen capture komo",0,1,0.8499359817019471,0.34993598170194706,false_positive

Even if the trend of declining cases had continued, the United States would not have eliminated TB by the end of this century, the CDC said. We are not yet certain why TB incidence has leveled off, but we do know it indicates the need for a new, expanded approach to TB elimination,  said Dr. Philip LoBue, director of the CDC s Division of Tuberculosis Elimination, in an email.A dual approach is needed: continue to find and treat cases of disease and evaluate their contacts, as well as identify and evaluate other high-risk persons for latent TB infection, he said.There may be a positive correlation between the increase in the number of refugees resettled in the United States during this period and the sudden increase in the incidence of tuberculosis, a disease that many thought was on the path to eradication in the United States.As the Centers for Disease Control report:In 2014, a total of 66% of reported TB cases in the United States occurred among foreign-born persons. The case rate among foreign-born persons (15.4 cases per 100,000 persons) in 2014 was approximately 13 times higher than among U.S.-born persons (1.2 cases per 100,000 persons). Today four states   California, New York, Texas and Florida   have more than half the nation s active TB cases, though they have only a third of the country s population. The four states have the highest numbers of foreign-born residents,  according to the Star Tribune.A person with latent tuberculosis is not infectious and does not have symptoms of the disease. A person with active tuberculosis is infectious and has symptoms of the disease.Ten percent of those with latent tuberculosis develop active tuberculosis if not treated, according to the World Health Organization.As the Star Tribune reports: Tuberculosis is airborne and can be spread when a person active tuberculosis coughs, sneezes, or otherwise transmits the infection to a previously uninfected individual.Treatment for tuberculosis is long and expensive. If caught early, it typically takes about nine months for a person with active tuberculosis to improve to latent tuberculosis. Not everyone diagnosed with active tuberculosis, however, improves.

,fake_true,WAKE UP AMERICA! CATERPILLAR JUST SCREWED OVER AMERICAN WORKERS Just Like Disney And Tech Companies [Video],"Outsider GOP candidate Donald Trump has vigorously denounced the outsourcing by Carrier s air-conditioning business. His opposition has helped him get a nine-point polling advantage in the state. But Trump s support for major reforms to the H-1B program to reduce the outsourcing of professional jobs is raising his support among upper-income professional-class voters in many other states.The Caterpillar outsourcing  is all the same thing happening over and over again,  said John Miano, a lawyer and software expert who has sued the federal government to reduce or stop various outsourcing programs, such as the H-1B visa.  What we see is that companies ask for more [H-1B visas] while they re laying off the same kind of [American professionals]   this is going to be an election that decides whether this continues,  Miano said.Early in 2016, Caterpillar asked the federal government for 71 H-1B visas needed to hire foreign white-collar college-grads. At least 30 of the requested H-1B visas are for engineers and other skilled professionals in Mossville, which is suffering the most layoffs.At least 44 of the visas requested in 2016 are for foreign graduates who are already working at Caterpillar in the United States. These  continuation  visas are automatically approved, and do not count against the much touted annual limits on H1-B visas.Another 22 of Caterpillar s visas are for new hires.Since 2012, Caterpillar has requested 768 visas for H-1B workers.

,fake_true, Poll: Majority Of Americans HATE Trump’s Unconstitutional Executive Orders,"While President Trump s approval rating continues to fall to embarrassing ans unprecedented levels, new polling has come out that shows dismal numbers of support towards his hateful, unconstitutional executive orders.According to Gallup Polling, the majority of the American public has an unfavorable view towards Trump s most controversial orders, including the ban on immigration refuge from seven majority-Muslim countries.Here s what the poll found:The poll also found that President Trump s approval rating 43% while his disapproval rating stands at 52 percent, a net negative 9 points. Only 41 percent of independent voters approve of Trump s performance as president, along with 83 percent of Republicans.Almost half of America believes Trump is acting  too fast  in his first days in office.Simply put: Trump is (still) hated by the American public and so are his most controversial executive actions. The only people that seem to like him are the Republicans that voted him in. Still, over one-sixth of the GOP doesn t seem to like him at this point.As Gallup s analysis concludes:Trump is not enjoying the type of honeymoon that the American public accorded his predecessors in their first weeks in office. Trump s initial job approval rating was the lowest in Gallup history, and a majority of Americans continue to disapprove of the job he is doing. No other president going back to Dwight Eisenhower had majority disapproval in his first several months in office. A majority of Americans, in similar fashion, disapprove of several of the high-visibility executive actions Trump has taken within his first 10 days in the White House.This polarization of opinion most likely reflects not only Trump himself   his style and the actions he has taken   but also the prevailing political environment today.The only thing Trump cares about is how people feel about him.

,fake_true, Support For Banning Assault Rifles Skyrockets After Orlando Shooting,"After the horrific terrorist attack in Orlando, which became the deadliest shooting in American history, a new poll from CBS shows that support for banning assault rifles has skyrocketed across the nation.The poll, conducted June 13th and 14th, shows that 57 percent of Americans support banning them, while 38 percent oppose. But the most surprising thing about these numbers is that in December of last year, only 44 percent of Americans supported a ban. That s a thirteen point difference in just six months.The poll also shows a shocking statistic   almost half of Republicans (45 percent) support the ban, while 78 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Independents do.According to the poll:On whether laws governing gun sales should be made more strict, Americans seem split along party lines. A majority   57 percent   believe that laws should be stricter, while 11 percent believe they should be less strict. About three in ten Americans think they should be kept as is.Not surprisingly, Republicans were in the minority on this issue as well.The overwhelming majority of Americans support such a ban, and only one candidate wants to see that happen   Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump doesn t because, in his own words, there are already too many of them on the streets so it would be fruitless (but deporting 11 million immigrants in this country? No problem).There is no doubt that the number has risen thanks to the ever eminent threat of mass gun violence plaguing this nation, and the attack in Orlando certainly didn t ease any fears.When it comes to the issues of expanding background checks, all political ideologies are in agreement. Over 92 percent of Republicans, 97 percent of Democrats, and 82 percent of Independents support stricter, universal background checks.If this trend continues, guns will become a serious policy point in the upcoming election (as it should be), and with the two candidates taking completely different approaches, the difference could not be starker.Featured image via David McNew/Getty Images","support for banning assault rifles skyrockets after orlando shooting after the horrific terrorist attack in orlando, which became the deadliest shooting in american history, a new poll from cbs shows that support for banning assault rifles has skyrocketed across the nation.the poll, conducted june 13th and 14th, shows that 57 percent of americans support banning them, while 38 percent oppose. but the most surprising thing about these numbers is that in december of last year, only 44 percent of americans supported a ban. that s a thirteen point difference in just six months.the poll also shows a shocking statistic almost half of republicans (45 percent) support the ban, while 78 percent of democrats and 47 percent of independents do.according to the poll:on whether laws governing gun sales should be made more strict, americans seem split along party lines. a majority 57 percent believe that laws should be stricter, while 11 percent believe they should be less strict. about three in ten americans think they should be kept as is.not surprisingly, republicans were in the minority on this issue as well.the overwhelming majority of americans support such a ban, and only one candidate wants to see that happen hillary clinton. donald trump doesn t because, in his own words, there are already too many of them on the streets so it would be fruitless (but deporting 11 million immigrants in this country? no problem).there is no doubt that the number has risen thanks to the ever eminent threat of mass gun violence plaguing this nation, and the attack in orlando certainly didn t ease any fears.when it comes to the issues of expanding background checks, all political ideologies are in agreement. over 92 percent of republicans, 97 percent of democrats, and 82 percent of independents support stricter, universal background checks.if this trend continues, guns will become a serious policy point in the upcoming election (as it should be), and with the two candidates taking completely different approaches, the difference could not be starker.featured image via david mcnew/getty images",0,1,0.844134066780482,0.344134066780482,false_positive

Look Who Just Knocked Trump Out Of The #1 Spot In GOP Poll,"This certainly isn t who the GOP power-brokers want to see in the top two Donald Trump has boasted that he s  leading every poll and in most cases big.  Not anymore. The latest IBD/TIPP Poll shows him in second place, seven points behind Ben Carson.The nationwide survey found that 24% of Republicans back Carson, compared with 17% who say they support Trump.Marco Rubio came in third with 11% and Carly Fiorina fourth at 9%. Jeb Bush, once considered a prohibitive favorite, ranked fifth with just 8% support, which was a point lower than those who say they are still undecided.The IBD/TIPP Poll has a proven track record for accuracy, based on its performance in the past three presidential elections. In a comparison of the final results of various pollsters for the 2004 and 2008 elections, IBD/TIPP was the most accurate. And the New York Times concluded that IBD/TIPP was the most accurate among 23 polls over the three weeks leading up to the 2012 election.The October poll, conducted from Sept. 26 to Oct. 1, included 377 registered voters who are Republican or registered independents who lean toward the Republican Party, with a margin of error of +/- 5 percentage points.Peak Trump? Other polls show Trump s support slipping in recent weeks. The Real Clear Politics average of six national polls shows him falling from 30.5% in mid-September to 23.3% by the end of the month. That average does not include the IBD/TIPP findings.  Things appear to be catching up with Trump on multiple fronts,  said Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, which conducts IBD s monthly poll.  In addition to facing increasing attacks from other candidates, Trump s boycott of Fox News may have set him back,  Mayur said, noting that the poll was being conducted during Trump s self-imposed hiatus.When asked on CNBC about his slipping poll numbers, Trump said that  if I fell behind badly, I would certainly get out. Carson s gain comes after his controversial remarks on  Meet the Press  that he couldn t support a Muslim for president. See story here. Rubio s third-place standing shows he has gained considerable ground since the second GOP debate.

,fake_true, Major City SLAPS Greedy CEOs Like Trump With Tax Penalty To Fight Income Inequality,"This is HUGE news!The city council of Portland, Oregon just did something awesome that could actually reduce the income inequality gap.As we all know, CEO pay has gotten out of control over the last few decades. Some CEOs even make more than 100 times what their employees make. And some of those CEOs have the gall to whine that providing benefits, better wages, and healthcare to their employees is a waste of money.Well, if these greedy CEOs want to operate in Portland they ll have to pay an extra tax that could inspire other American cities to do the same thing.According to the Institute for Policy Studies,In a 3-1 vote, the council agreed to add a surtax on the city s existing business license tax for firms that pay their CEOs more than 100 times what their typical worker receives. This will be the nation s first tax penalty for extreme CEO-worker pay gaps.On how the tax will be levied and which companies will be affected, Truthout.org spoke to IPS co-editor Sarah Anderson, who explained that the city has already found over 500 companies that will see a rise in their taxes soon.Publicly traded companies with extreme pay gaps will pay a surtax on top of the city s current business license tax. The surtax will be 10 percent of the business tax liability for companies with a CEO-worker pay ratio of more than 100-to-1 and 25 percent for companies with a ratio of more than 250-to-1. The Portland government has identified more than 500 corporations that do enough business in the city to be affected by the surtax, including many that regularly dominate the highest-paid CEO lists, such as Oracle, Honeywell, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and General Electric.So once again, the fight on behalf of workers is centered in Oregon. Earlier this year, Oregon raised the minimum wage to nearly $15 an hour. Meanwhile, Donald Trump s cabinet is stacked with billionaires and his tax plan favors the top one percent.According to a Tax Policy Center chart posted to Twitter by Morning Joe economic wonk Steven Rattner, Trump s tax plan will give the top 0.1 percent a $1.1 million tax cut while the bottom 20 percent only get a cut of $110.Under Trump s plan, the top 0.1% get an avg tax cut of $1.1mm; the bottom 20% get only $110.

,fake_true, Just FOUR Home Loans Were Given To African-Americans In This Major City In A Whole Year,"The City of Oakland California has a population of over 390,000 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. 28 percent of the population is African-American, yet the top 12 lenders in the nation helped African Americans borrow to purchase a home just four times in the entire year of 2013. Hispanic borrowers received only seven home loans, according to a recent study by the Greenlining Institute and Strategies Council.Big Banks have been ridiculed for racist lending practices since the 2008 economic recession partially caused by the collapse of the housing market. Countrywide Financial, a subsidiary of Bank of America, overcharged 200,000 African-Americans and Latinos for mortgages at the height of the housing boom. Bank of America settled with the Justice Department in 2011 to pay $335 million dollars in claims against the company. In those circumstances, discrimination was profitable,  wrote Jordan Weismann for the Atlantic in 2011.  Greed fueled a system that created a pattern of racial bias. Post 2008 economic recession, the racial bias in mortgage lending has gone from overcharging to turning down mortgage applications of African-Americans. Racial disparities were discovered across the state of California, as African-Americans make up just 2 percent of mortgage lending originations while consisting of 6.5 percent of the state s population. As the nation recovered from the recent economic crisis, the majority of Californians were locked out of the 2013 housing market missing the most affordable time to buy a home,  wrote the study authors.  44 percent of California s residents the combined African American and Hispanic populations obtained just 10.5 percent of total mortgage dollars lent by the top 12 lenders statewide. Sadly, these disparities were more pronounced in three cities where African Americans and Hispanics averaged 56 percent of the population. Racism in mortgage lending isn t a phenomenon unique to California, but rampant across the United States.In September 2015, Evans Bank settled a $825,000 lawsuit with New York State for racist lending practices. JP Morgan was sued by the City of Miami for discriminatory practices in 2014, along with Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America. PNC Bank was asked by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to pay $35 million in restitution for the discriminatory practices between 2002 and 2008 of a bank they bought, National City Bank.In the City of Denver, the National Fair Housing Alliance exposed racist practices by U.S. Bank in 2014. These are just a few examples of the banks who were caught conducting discriminatory practices as these trends remain persistent among the largest and smallest banks in the country, while minority communities continue to suffer from being denied the right to purchases a home, or the exorbitant extra fees they are charged because of their race.

Customers collecting taxpayer subsidies this year will be 11 million, down from the 15 million the CBO projected a year ago.The grim news comes with less than a year left for President Obama to put the law on firmer footing as he seeks to head off what is likely to be a last effort at repealing the act after November s elections.The economic front is somewhat brighter for Mr. Obama, who seven years into the recovery will finally see significant sustained growth of 2.5 percent this year and 2.6 percent next year, the CBO said.That will be followed by a cooling off, with growth dropping below 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. The economic gains will continue to go disproportionately to the wealthy, helping boost income tax revenue but limiting payroll taxes, which will put even more pressure on the entitlement programs that are driving up deficits.The biggest fiscal dent, however, was made late last year when Mr. Obama and the Republican-run Congress struck a deal. The president won significant spending hikes, and Republicans insisted on a new round of special tax breaks that, combined, reversed years of progress and added nearly $750 billion to projected deficits over the next decade.

The president won significant spending hikes, and Republicans insisted on a new round of special tax breaks that, combined, reversed years of progress and added nearly $750 billion to projected deficits over the next decade. After six consecutive years in which the deficit has declined relative to the size of the economy, this year s deficit   at 2.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)   is anticipated to increase for the first time since it peaked at 9.8 percent in 2009,  the CBO said.Deficits will continue to rise over the next 10 years, topping $1 trillion again in 2022 and reaching $1.4 trillion in 2026, the analysts said.The accumulation of those deficits will deepen the gross public debt from $18.1 trillion at the end of 2015 to $29.3 trillion in 2026. By contrast, the debt stood at $10.6 trillion when Mr. Obama took office in 2009.Looking decades into the future, the picture only gets worse, the CBO said.READ MORE: WT","warning: feds predict $30 trillion dollar debt because of these two key things you can blame the escalating debt on obamacare and taxes we can thank obama for this the federal government will be flirting with $30 trillion in debt within a decade, the congressional budget office reported monday, blaming an aging population, new spending and tax cuts approved on capitol hill, and the growing burden from obamacare for erasing the progress washington had made over the past few years.analysts said obamacare will chase more workers out of the labor force over the next five years, adding pressure to an economy still struggling to spring to life more than seven years into the obama recovery.the affordable care act itself is still struggling to attract a customer base, the cbo said, lowering its estimate for the number of people who will sign up for the exchanges from 21 million to 13 million a drop of nearly 40 percent in projections. customers collecting taxpayer subsidies this year will be 11 million, down from the 15 million the cbo projected a year ago.the grim news comes with less than a year left for president obama to put the law on firmer footing as he seeks to head off what is likely to be a last effort at repealing the act after november s elections.the economic front is somewhat brighter for mr. obama, who seven years into the recovery will finally see significant sustained growth of 2.5 percent this year and 2.6 percent next year, the cbo said.that will be followed by a cooling off, with growth dropping below 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. the economic gains will continue to go disproportionately to the wealthy, helping boost income tax revenue but limiting payroll taxes, which will put even more pressure on the entitlement programs that are driving up deficits.the biggest fiscal dent, however, was made late last year when mr. obama and the republican-run congress struck a deal. the president won significant spending hikes, and republicans insisted on a new round of special tax breaks that, combined, reversed years of progress and added nearly $750 billion to projected deficits over the next decade. after six consecutive years in which the deficit has declined relative to the size of the economy, this year s deficit at 2.9 percent of gross domestic product (gdp) is anticipated to increase for the first time since it peaked at 9.8 percent in 2009, the cbo said.deficits will continue to rise over the next 10 years, topping $1 trillion again in 2022 and reaching $1.4 trillion in 2026, the analysts said.the accumulation of those deficits will deepen the gross public debt from $18.1 trillion at the end of 2015 to $29.3 trillion in 2026. by contrast, the debt stood at $10.6 trillion when mr. obama took office in 2009.looking decades into the future, the picture only gets worse, the cbo said.read more: wt",0,1,0.8394362624647091,0.33943626246470915,false_positive
,fake_true, Republican Governor Scott Walker Makes Poverty Hit Highest Level In 30 Years,"On February 26, 2016, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, published an article entitled  Poverty Across Wisconsin Reaches Highest Level In 30 Years.  The poverty trends were compiled from U.S. Census data by University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers. Between 2009 and 2014, 13 percent of Wisconsin residents were living in poverty, the highest percentage since 1984. Scott Walker took office as Governor of Wisconsin on January 3, 2011.The researchers also analyzed a study by the Economic Innovation Group which found Milwaukee, the largest city in Wisconsin, is the seventh most economically distressed city in America, with 52 percent of the population under economic distress.The researchers also discovered poverty went up in both urban and rural areas of Wisconsin, and every educational background.According to the analysis,  for those with a high school education, poverty rose from 8.9 percent to 11 percent. It also rose from 6.6 percent to 8.9 percent among those who had attended  some college, and poverty also touched those with bachelor s degrees or more, rising from 3 percent to 3.6 percent. Child poverty also dramatically increased, as did the poverty gap between African-Americans and whites while the gap remained flat in most areas of the country during the same time period. The researchers cited the causes for increases in poverty as the broadening gap in wealth and income inequality, in which the highest income earners experience increases in wealth and income as wages for the working and middle classes remain virtually stagnant.The administration of Scott Walker certainly hasn t helped the residents of Wisconsin. Instead of creating jobs and improving wages for workers, Walker has led battles against workers rights, while providing tax breaks to the rich. Massive layoffs in the state have become a regular occurrence. Walker s,  Act 10  revoked collective bargaining rights for public employees to unionize, and cut their wages by ten percent. Walker has also signed several anti-union bills into law and increased subsidies for corporations while the state s minimum wage remains at the federal minimum of $7.25. The only people who have thrived in Wisconsin since Scott Walker assumed office is himself and the special interests who support him like the Koch Brothers.

,fake_true, The Numbers Are In: Trump Is The Most Hated Newly Inaugurated President EVER,"It s been less than a week since Donald Trump took the oath of office, and already he s breaking records left and right (and none of them are good).Simply put: Donald Trump is the most hated incoming president this country has seen in at least 60 years.According to Gallup Polling:President Donald Trump is the first elected president in Gallup s polling history to receive an initial job approval rating below the majority level. He starts his term in office with 45% of Americans approving of the way he is handling his new job, 45% disapproving and 10% yet to form an opinion. Trump now holds the record for the lowest initial job approval rating as well as the highest initial disapproval rating in Gallup surveys dating back to Dwight D. Eisenhower.Congratulations, America.

Ninety percent of Republicans give him approval while 81 percent of Democrats disapprove. Independents have a slightly more negative view than they do positive (44-40 percent).Knowing that his pre-inaugural numbers and the turnout for the Women s March sent him into a frenzy, these numbers should only exasperate the new authoritarian-in-chief.Featured image via Getty Images","the numbers are in: trump is the most hated newly inaugurated president ever it s been less than a week since donald trump took the oath of office, and already he s breaking records left and right (and none of them are good).simply put: donald trump is the most hated incoming president this country has seen in at least 60 years.according to gallup polling:president donald trump is the first elected president in gallup s polling history to receive an initial job approval rating below the majority level. he starts his term in office with 45% of americans approving of the way he is handling his new job, 45% disapproving and 10% yet to form an opinion. trump now holds the record for the lowest initial job approval rating as well as the highest initial disapproval rating in gallup surveys dating back to dwight d. eisenhower.congratulations, america. you nominated a man you vehemently hate (more so than george w. bush).to put it in perspective, let s look at the numbers for trump and past presidents:donald trump approve: 45 percent. disapprove: 45 percentbarack obama approve: 68 percent. disapprove: 12 percentgeorge w. bush approve: 57 percent. disapprove: 25 percentbill clinton approve: 58 percent. disapprove: 20 percentgeorge h.w. bush approve: 51 percent. disapprove: 6 percentronald reagan: approve: 51 percent. disapprove: 13 percentjimmy carter approve: 68 percent. disapprove: 8 percentrichard nixon approve: 59 percent. disapprove: 5 percentjohn f kennedy approve: 72 percent. disapprove: 6 percentdwight d. eisenhower approve: 68 percent. disapprove: 7 percentouch. if trump can t even beat out richard nixon and george w. bush (who won a contentious and blistering recount), that says something.of course trump s biggest base of support men, whites and no college education loved him while all the others women, people of color and the educated despise him. ninety percent of republicans give him approval while 81 percent of democrats disapprove. independents have a slightly more negative view than they do positive (44-40 percent).knowing that his pre-inaugural numbers and the turnout for the women s march sent him into a frenzy, these numbers should only exasperate the new authoritarian-in-chief.featured image via getty images",0,1,0.8367523536627143,0.3367523536627143,false_positive
,fake_true,STUDY REVEALS MASSIVE SPENDING: Shocking Welfare Use By Immigrants Cannot Go On!,"THE CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES IS AMAZING AT GETTING TO THE FACTS IN THE IMMIGRATION BATTLE: They bring to the table a huge set of figures that should shock every American into action on the state AND federal level. The bottom line is that YOU are paying way too much for legal AND illegal immigrants to come to America and live off of your tax dollars! We cannot and should not go on like this! Please read up and share!A new study on the use of welfare benefits by illegal and legal immigrants in the U.S. finds that households headed by immigrants use an average of $6,200 in benefits annually, fully 41 percent higher than the rate used by native born welfare recipients:This study comes on the heels of another study finding that 51 percent of immigrant households are signed up for at least one welfare program.  Immigrants are such heavy users of welfare not because they don t work, but because, on average, they have little education and thus earn low wages,  said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS).  If we continue to permit large numbers of less-educated people to move here from abroad, we have to accept that there will be huge and ongoing costs to taxpayers.  The study, based on the Census Bureau s 2012 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), notes that the higher use of welfare benefits because by and large the current wave of immigrants are less educated and have fewer needed job skills and are therefore more apt to apply for welfare benefits.The study found the average immigrant household receives 33 percent more cash welfare, 57 percent more food assistance, and 44 percent more Medicaid dollars than the average native-born applicants. Additionally, the highest amount of welfare is taken by immigrants from Central America and Mexico at $8,251 per household, a rate 86 percent higher than native citizens.  The greater consumption of welfare dollars by immigrants can be explained in large part by their lower level of education and larger number of children compared to natives,  CIS said in a press release.  Over 24 percent of immigrant households are headed by a high school dropout, compared to just 8 percent of native households. In addition, 13 percent of immigrant households have three or more children, vs. just 6 percent of native households.   While it is important for Americans to understand the rate of welfare use among immigrants, expressing that use in dollar terms offers a more tangible metric that is tied to current debates over fiscal policy. With the nation facing a long-term budgetary deficit, this study helps illuminate immigration s impact on the problem,  said the report s author, Jason Richwine. Richwine also noted that even as illegal immigrants are supposed to be barred from receiving welfare they receive it anyway by applying for benefits for their American-born children, often called  anchor babies. Via: Breitbart","study reveals massive spending: shocking welfare use by immigrants cannot go on! the center for immigration studies is amazing at getting to the facts in the immigration battle: they bring to the table a huge set of figures that should shock every american into action on the state and federal level. the bottom line is that you are paying way too much for legal and illegal immigrants to come to america and live off of your tax dollars! we cannot and should not go on like this! please read up and share!a new study on the use of welfare benefits by illegal and legal immigrants in the u.s. finds that households headed by immigrants use an average of $6,200 in benefits annually, fully 41 percent higher than the rate used by native born welfare recipients:this study comes on the heels of another study finding that 51 percent of immigrant households are signed up for at least one welfare program. immigrants are such heavy users of welfare not because they don t work, but because, on average, they have little education and thus earn low wages, said mark krikorian, executive director of the center for immigration studies (cis). if we continue to permit large numbers of less-educated people to move here from abroad, we have to accept that there will be huge and ongoing costs to taxpayers. the study, based on the census bureau s 2012 survey of income and program participation (sipp), notes that the higher use of welfare benefits because by and large the current wave of immigrants are less educated and have fewer needed job skills and are therefore more apt to apply for welfare benefits.the study found the average immigrant household receives 33 percent more cash welfare, 57 percent more food assistance, and 44 percent more medicaid dollars than the average native-born applicants. additionally, the highest amount of welfare is taken by immigrants from central america and mexico at $8,251 per household, a rate 86 percent higher than native citizens. the greater consumption of welfare dollars by immigrants can be explained in large part by their lower level of education and larger number of children compared to natives, cis said in a press release. over 24 percent of immigrant households are headed by a high school dropout, compared to just 8 percent of native households. in addition, 13 percent of immigrant households have three or more children, vs. just 6 percent of native households. while it is important for americans to understand the rate of welfare use among immigrants, expressing that use in dollar terms offers a more tangible metric that is tied to current debates over fiscal policy. with the nation facing a long-term budgetary deficit, this study helps illuminate immigration s impact on the problem, said the report s author, jason richwine. richwine also noted that even as illegal immigrants are supposed to be barred from receiving welfare they receive it anyway by applying for benefits for their american-born children, often called anchor babies. via: breitbart",0,1,0.8332847336928794,0.33328473369287936,false_positive

,fake_true,OOPS! NEW BREAKING POLLS SHOWS DONALD TRUMP IS MORE POPULAR THAN JOHN MCCAIN WITH VETS,"McCain s war hero status is not in question with the American voter, but his service to our nation as a Senator is clearly an issue Donald Trump leads the GOP presidential field again this week, though controversial remarks about Sen. John McCain may have dented his popularity among RepublicansDonald Trump s rise in the Republican contest for the 2016 presidential nomination doesn t appear to have been slowed much   at least not yet   by the recent controversy over his criticisms of Arizona Sen. John McCain s war record last weekend. In fact, although Trump s favorable ratings among Republicans have declined, he is still ahead   and far ahead   when Republicans are asked to choose among the 16 currently announced candidates.In last week s poll, Donald Trump received the highest favorable ratings of any candidate from Republicans, apparently helped by his tough position on illegal immigration. This week, however, Trump s favorable ratings dropped 11 points, and his unfavorable rating has risen 15 points.DONALD TRUMP AND JOHN MCCAINA separate YouGov poll completed Wednesday suggests a reason why the McCain controversy may not have affected Trump as much as some expected. Two out of three Republicans view McCain as a war hero. But fewer say they have a favorable opinion of him. In fact, Republicans in that poll gave both Trump and McCain similar ratings.The differences between the Trump favorable ratings in the Economist/YouGov Poll and the daily poll are not significant.In addition, while a majority of Republicans (54%) think Trump should apologize for this statement about Trump:  He s not a war hero. He s a war hero  cause he was captured. I like people that weren t captured. OK? Perhaps he was a war hero, but now he s said some very bad things about a lot of people.  32% of Republicans believe he doesn t need to apologize. In fact, more Democrats than Republicans want Trump to apologize.Even more striking, veterans and those currently in the military are more likely to have favorable views of Trump than to have favorable views of McCain. 41% say they have favorable views of McCain, while more than half are favorable to Trump.Veterans are divided on whether Trump owes McCain an apology.While a core of Republicans appear to have coalesced around a Trump candidacy, the New York businessman has yet to cross the threshold of being viewed as a likely winner with many Republicans. More than three times as many Republican-identifying registered voters view Bush as the likely Republican nominee than say Trump is that person. 36% call Bush the likely winner, 11% choose Walker, and just 10% name Trump.Via: YouGov US","oops! new breaking polls shows donald trump is more popular than john mccain with vets mccain s war hero status is not in question with the american voter, but his service to our nation as a senator is clearly an issue donald trump leads the gop presidential field again this week, though controversial remarks about sen. john mccain may have dented his popularity among republicansdonald trump s rise in the republican contest for the 2016 presidential nomination doesn t appear to have been slowed much at least not yet by the recent controversy over his criticisms of arizona sen. john mccain s war record last weekend. in fact, although trump s favorable ratings among republicans have declined, he is still ahead and far ahead when republicans are asked to choose among the 16 currently announced candidates.in last week s poll, donald trump received the highest favorable ratings of any candidate from republicans, apparently helped by his tough position on illegal immigration. this week, however, trump s favorable ratings dropped 11 points, and his unfavorable rating has risen 15 points.donald trump and john mccaina separate yougov poll completed wednesday suggests a reason why the mccain controversy may not have affected trump as much as some expected. two out of three republicans view mccain as a war hero. but fewer say they have a favorable opinion of him. in fact, republicans in that poll gave both trump and mccain similar ratings.the differences between the trump favorable ratings in the economist/yougov poll and the daily poll are not significant.in addition, while a majority of republicans (54%) think trump should apologize for this statement about trump: he s not a war hero. he s a war hero cause he was captured. i like people that weren t captured. ok? perhaps he was a war hero, but now he s said some very bad things about a lot of people. 32% of republicans believe he doesn t need to apologize. in fact, more democrats than republicans want trump to apologize.even more striking, veterans and those currently in the military are more likely to have favorable views of trump than to have favorable views of mccain. 41% say they have favorable views of mccain, while more than half are favorable to trump.veterans are divided on whether trump owes mccain an apology.while a core of republicans appear to have coalesced around a trump candidacy, the new york businessman has yet to cross the threshold of being viewed as a likely winner with many republicans. more than three times as many republican-identifying registered voters view bush as the likely republican nominee than say trump is that person. 36% call bush the likely winner, 11% choose walker, and just 10% name trump.via: yougov us",0,1,0.8312100029644545,0.33121000296445446,false_positive

,fake_true, POLL: Trump Is The Least Popular President Of All Time — And It’s Getting Worse,"Donald Trump may think he s the best, but it looks like most Americans disagree. In reality, he s the worst. Numerous polls show that Trump is the least popular president ever. And the more time passes, the lower his approval rating sinks.The most recent Gallup Poll shows Trump s approval rating at a mere 37 percent, with 58 percent of Americans disapproving of the job he s doing as president. That s down from a brief stint at 40 percent approval earlier this month. His lowest approval ratings came in March when only 35 percent thought he was doing a decent job in the White House, but he is darn close to that now.In fact, other polls show that he has already reached the magic number of 35 percent approval, his all-time low. The American Research Group has Trump s approval rating at 35 percent, which has dropped from 37 percent approval in June and 39 percent in both May and April. Rasmussen Reports, Trump s favorite poll, also showed that Trump s approval rating is currently tied with his all-time low.According to Newsweek, Trump is closing in on his record low approval ratings in just about every poll out there. Five Thirty Eight has Trump s approval rating at 38.4 percent, just 0.4 points above his all-time low.But these aren t just record lows for Trump, they are record lows for any U.S. president ever.

,fake_true,HAPPY LABOR DAY! 5 STUNNING FACTS: How Obama Family Has Taken Full Advantage Of Everyday Working Americans,"Happy Labor Day! Today is a day to celebrate working Americans and the contribution they make to our nation and to its prosperity. It s also a great time to consider what Obama has done to help Americans get jobs, improve wages, and to improve their living conditions. Have you ever wondered how much time off the average American takes for a family vacation as compared to Obama, or how much time they spend on the golf course? How much does the average American, who can actually afford to take a family vacation spend? How does the average American senior who s paid taxes their entire lives fare next to Michelle s 5-star, American taxpayer funded mom?A record 94,708,000 Americans were not in the labor force in May, 2016   664,000 more than in April   and the labor force participation rate dropped two-tenths of a point to 62.6 percent, near its 38-year low, according to the Labor Department s Bureau of Labor Statistics.When President Obama took office in January 2009, 80,529,000 Americans were not participating in the labor force; since then, 14,179,000 Americans have left the workforce   some of them retiring and some just quitting because they can t find work. By almost every economic measure, America is better off than when I came here at the beginning of my presidency,  President Obama told the people of Elkhart, Indiana in June, 2016.  We cut unemployment in half, years before a lot of economists thought we would. While the unemployment rate in May dropped to 4.7 percent, BLS reported, less than half of its Obama-era high of 10 percent in October 2009, the labor force participation rate overall, has deteriorated over Obama s two terms.FIVE FUN LABOR DAY FACTS 1) OBAMA S NET WORTH SINCE 2007:Barack and Michelle Obama s net-worth has risen 438% since Obama decided to run for office. Apparently, being a public servant and an oppressed First Lady pays big dividends.According to financial disclosure reports, President Obama has an estimated net worth of $7 million dollars.Since he was worth $1.3 million in 2007, that makes the millionaire 438% more wealthy than when he first ran for office.EVERYDAY AMERICANS:The average American income in 2015 was $53,657. Americans didn t get a raise last year. In fact, they haven t gotten one in years.The typical American family income was $53,657 in 2014, barely changed from $54,462 a year earlier, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Wednesday.What s worse   it s far below the peak set in 1999. That s a major reason why so many Americans are still gloomy about the economy six years into the recovery.2) OBAMA VACATIONS:Obama took an average of 21.5 vacations days per year in his first four years as president.Judicial Watch did a little digging on the travel costs of Obama s vacation on the West Coast back in October and found in the process that Obama has now racked up OVER $73 MILLION in travel expenses in his 7 years as president.Though some of the expenses incurred while fundraising are supposed to be reimbursed by political parties and campaigns,  only a small portion  of the president s travel costs are actually repaid, and, unsurprisingly, the White House  keeps the formula for such cost-sharing secret. Perhaps most depressing about the president s exorbitant travel expenses is that those figures do not even present the full cost of his spending on vacations, which inevitably include huge security, room and board, and entertainment (think golf) expenses.As for his West Coast fundraising jaunts, Obama used the trip as a way to promote his gun control agenda, party with Kanye West, and hit up Hollywood elites for big-dollar donations. Oh yeah, and he briefly squeezed in a visit with the families of victims of the San Bernardino terror attack that took the lives of 14.AVERAGE EVERYDAY AMERICAN:Private-industry workers in the United States who have at least 20 years on the job get an average of 19 days of paid vacation per year.According to American Express, the average vacation expense per person in the United States is $1,145, or $4,580 for a family of four. More than half of Americans, 56%, have not taken a vacation in the last year, according to the insurance company Allianz Global Assistance. That s equivalent to 135 million people. The survey defined vacation as a week off from work during which those surveyed travelled at least 100 miles away from home.Another survey of 1,005 Americans, conducted last year by Skift, found that just 15% of Americans planned to take a real vacation in 2014. That same survey found that 33% of Americans couldn t afford a vacation, 30% were too busy and that 22% were going to take a short vacation over a summer weekend.3) OBAMA S LEISURE TIME:Barack Obama has played over 300 rounds of golf, or an average of over 40 rounds per year since he took office in 2008.EVERYDAY AMERICAN:The National Golf Foundation identifies core golfers  in America as those who play an average of eight rounds per year.4). OBAMA AND MICHELLE S LUXURIOUS TAXPAYER FUNDED 5-STAR EXISTENCE:Since the beginning of Barack Obama s administration, the Obamas have become increasingly notorious for unnecessary, luxurious travel, under the guise of official business.According to records obtained by Judicial Watch through FOIA requests and subsequent lawsuits, the Obamas and Bidens have spent millions of taxpayer dollars on trips, beginning with the Obamas  much-publicized New York City  date night  in 2009 up through the president s most frequent golf outings and the first lady s Aspen ski jaunts.Judicial Watch uncovered an expensive combination of trips by the Obamas to Africa and Honolulu, which cost taxpayers $15,885,585.30 in flight expenses alone. The single largest prior known expense for accommodations was for Michelle Obama s side-trip to Dublin, Ireland, during the 2013 G-8 conference in Belfast, when she and her entourage booked 30 rooms at the five-star Shelbourne Hotel, and where she stayed in the 1500 square-foot Princess Grace suite at a cost of $3,500 a night.The total cost to taxpayers for the Obamas  Ireland trip was $7,921,638.66. To date, the known beyond-first-class travel expenses of the Obamas and Vice President Joe Biden exceed $57 million.In February, Michelle Obama took a weekend trip to Aspen, Colorado that cost taxpayers a pretty penny; $57,068.80 in travel expenses alone for the 7.4 hour-round trip flight, according to U.S.Air Force records.5) THE ULTIMATE 5-STAR, TAXPAYER FUNDED OBAMA FAMILY FREE-LOADER:Michelle Obama s mother, Marian Robinson, has been living like a queen ever since her daughter moved into the White House. Just take a look at all of the vacations you ve paid for her to take as an extended member of the First Family:Tagging along with the First Family doesn t come cheap, but of course, Robinson isn t the one footing the bill. That responsibility lands squarely on the shoulders of hard-working taxpayers like you and me.So why are we saddled with this extra expense at a time when the American taxpayer is already so burdened by an out-of-control national deficit? According to the Washington Examiner, it s because Robinson  cares for her grandchildren in the White House. Really???The Obama girls are certainly old enough to care for themselves. At the very least, they do not need a glorified nanny to accompany them around the world, costing millions of extra dollars in travel expenses. Malia is preparing to start college; she s definitely too old for a babysitter.Perhaps the Obamas are not breaking any laws by ensuring that Marian Robinson gets to live the high life during their years in the White House, but they are being incredibly insensitive, which honestly, we have come to expect from the self-indulgent family. After all, the First Lady is embarking on her third vacation in as many months in just a couple weeks.EVERYDAY AMERICAN:The average American retiree (or those 65 and older) is spending about $3,600 per month   or about $43,600 per year. Using the 4% rule, that would mean a nest egg of over $1 million would be needed to finance the  average  lifestyle.More and more Americans over the age of 65 are struggling with mounting debt levels, fueled primarily by mortgages and credit cards. The average debt held by senior citizens has ballooned to $50,000 in 2010, up 83% since 2001, according to Federal Reserve data crunched by the Employee Benefit Research Institute.Much of this is due to an increase in housing-related debt. Families headed by someone at least 60 years old had the largest increase in average mortgage debt, in terms of percentage, between 2000 and 2012, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.Of course, Marian doesn t have to worry about housing, food or 5-star vacation costs. She was quietly moved into the taxpayer funded White House in 2008 under the guise of a  nanny  for the Obama girls. She has somehow managed to continue living on the tax-payer dime without any media scrutiny. Even though the oldest Obama daughter is now in college and the youngest daughter is perfectly capable of brushing her own teeth, taxpayer funded granny has enjoyed a lifestyle that 99% of American seniors can only dream about. The king and Queen of extravagant vacations, free-loading grannies and golf and will be gone in 4 months and the only thing we ll have to show for it is a multi-million dollar tab.Work harder America the Obama s lived it up on our dime and now we have a massive tab to pay.Happy Labor Day!","happy labor day! 5 stunning facts: how obama family has taken full advantage of everyday working americans

before a lot of economists thought we would. while the unemployment rate in may dropped to 4.7 percent, bls reported, less than half of its obama-era high of 10 percent in october 2009, the labor force participation rate overall, has deteriorated over obama s two terms.five fun labor day facts 1) obama s net worth since 2007:barack and michelle obama s net-worth has risen 438% since obama decided to run for office. apparently, being a public servant and an oppressed first lady pays big dividends.according to financial disclosure reports, president obama has an estimated net worth of $7 million dollars.since he was worth $1.3 million in 2007, that makes the millionaire 438% more wealthy than when he first ran for office.everyday americans:the average american income in 2015 was $53,657. americans didn t get a raise last year. in fact, they haven t gotten one in years.the typical american family income was $53,657 in 2014, barely changed from $54,462 a year earlier, the u.s. census bureau reported wednesday.what s worse it s far below the peak set in 1999. that s a major reason why so many americans are still gloomy about the economy six years into the recovery.2) obama vacations:obama took an average of 21.5 vacations days per year in his first four years as president.judicial watch did a little digging on the travel costs of obama s vacation on the west coast back in october and found in the process that obama has now racked up over $73 million in travel expenses in his 7 years as president.though some of the expenses incurred while fundraising are supposed to be reimbursed by political parties and campaigns, only a small portion of the president s travel costs are actually repaid, and, unsurprisingly, the white house keeps the formula for such cost-sharing secret. perhaps most depressing about the president s exorbitant travel expenses is that those figures do not even present the full cost of his spending on vacations, which inevitably include huge security, room and board, and entertainment (think golf) expenses.as for his west coast fundraising jaunts, obama used the trip as a way to promote his gun control agenda, party with kanye west, and hit up hollywood elites for big-dollar donations. oh yeah, and he briefly squeezed in a visit with the families of victims of the san bernardino terror attack that took the lives of 14.average everyday american:private-industry workers in the united states who have at least 20 years on the job get an average of 19 days of paid vacation per year.according to american express, the average vacation expense per person in the united states is $1,145, or $4,580 for a family of four. more than half of americans, 56%, have not taken a vacation in the last year, according to the insurance company allianz global assistance. that s equivalent to 135 million people. the survey defined vacation as a week off from work during which those surveyed travelled at least 100 miles away from home.another survey of 1,005 americans, conducted last year by skift, found that just 15% of americans planned to take a real vacation in 2014. that same survey found that 33% of americans couldn t afford a vacation, 30% were too busy and that 22% were going to take a short vacation over a summer weekend.3) obama s leisure time:barack obama has played over 300 rounds of golf, or an average of over 40 rounds per year since he took office in 2008.everyday american:the national golf foundation identifies core golfers in america as those who play an average of eight rounds per year.4). obama and michelle s luxurious taxpayer funded 5-star existence:since the beginning of barack obama s administration, the obamas have become increasingly notorious for unnecessary, luxurious travel, under the guise of official business.according to records obtained by judicial watch through foia requests and subsequent lawsuits, the obamas and bidens have spent millions of taxpayer dollars on trips, beginning with the obamas much-publicized new york city date night in 2009 up through the president s most frequent golf outings and the first lady s aspen ski jaunts.judicial watch uncovered an expensive combination of trips by the obamas to africa and honolulu, which cost taxpayers $15,885,585.30 in flight expenses alone. the single largest prior known expense for accommodations was for michelle obama s side-trip to dublin, ireland, during the 2013 g-8 conference in belfast, when she and her entourage booked 30 rooms at the five-star shelbourne hotel, and where she stayed in the 1500 square-foot princess grace suite at a cost of $3,500 a night.the total cost to taxpayers for the obamas ireland trip was $7,921,638.66. to date, the known beyond-first-class travel expenses of the obamas and vice president joe biden exceed $57 million.in february, michelle obama took a weekend trip to aspen, colorado that cost taxpayers a pretty penny; $57,068.80 in travel expenses alone for the 7.4 hour-round trip flight, according to u.s.air force records.5) the ultimate 5-star, taxpayer funded obama family free-loader:michelle obama s mother, marian robinson, has been living like a queen ever since her daughter moved into the white house. just take a look at all of the vacations you ve paid for her to take as an extended member of the first family:tagging along with the first family doesn t come cheap, but of course, robinson isn t the one footing the bill. that responsibility lands squarely on the shoulders of hard-working taxpayers like you and me.so why are we saddled with this extra expense at a time when the american taxpayer is already so burdened by an out-of-control national deficit? according to the washington examiner, it s because robinson cares for her grandchildren in the white house. really???the obama girls are certainly old enough to care for themselves. at the very least, they do not need a glorified nanny to accompany them around the world, costing millions of extra dollars in travel expenses. malia is preparing to start college; she s definitely too old for a babysitter.perhaps the obamas are not breaking any laws by ensuring that marian robinson gets to live the high life during their years in the white house, but they are being incredibly insensitive, which honestly, we have come to expect from the self-indulgent family. after all, the first lady is embarking on her third vacation in as many months in just a couple weeks.everyday american:the average american retiree (or those 65 and older) is spending about $3,600 per month or about $43,600 per year. using the 4% rule, that would mean a nest egg of over $1 million would be needed to finance the average lifestyle.more and more americans over the age of 65 are struggling with mounting debt levels, fueled primarily by mortgages and credit cards. the average debt held by senior citizens has ballooned to $50,000 in 2010, up 83% since 2001, according to federal reserve data crunched by the employee benefit research institute.much of this is due to an increase in housing-related debt. families headed by someone at least 60 years old had the largest increase in average mortgage debt, in terms of percentage, between 2000 and 2012, according to the st. louis federal reserve.of course, marian doesn t have to worry about housing, food or 5-star vacation costs. she was quietly moved into the taxpayer funded white house in 2008 under the guise of a nanny for the obama girls. she has somehow managed to continue living on the tax-payer dime without any media scrutiny. even though the oldest obama daughter is now in college and the youngest daughter is perfectly capable of brushing her own teeth, taxpayer funded granny has enjoyed a lifestyle that 99% of american seniors can only dream about. the king and queen of extravagant vacations, free-loading grannies and golf and will be gone in 4 months and the only thing we ll have to show for it is a multi-million dollar tab.work harder america the obama s lived it up on our dime and now we have a massive tab to pay.happy labor day!",0,1,0.8297805577975166,0.3297805577975166,false_positive
,fake_true," Trump Just Broke A New Record, Finally Has A ‘Win’ That Will Shock America (IMAGE)","Donald Trump doesn t have any legislative wins under his belt yet, but there s one thing he s been really good at   shattering records with his historically low approval rating.Thanks to a new Gallup poll, we now know that Trump s disapproval rating has a three-day rolling average of 60 percent, beating his own previous record. You can check out the stats below:According to Gallup: Trump s approval ratings are also near his administration s low point when looking at the three-day approval ratings Gallup reports daily. For June 10-12, Trump averaged 36% approval, one point above his low of 35% measured March 26-28. Trump s current three-day average of 60% disapproval is, by one point, the highest of his administration. Now that a vast majority of Americans   many of which are probably Republicans or Trump voters   are finally admitting that they want Trump out of the White House, we couldn t be happier. It s clear that Trump s insane Russia scandal is taking a toll on his standing with the country, and his many losses are undoubtedly helping him become more unpopular by the day.These numbers from Gallup come just as the Senate Republicans are trying to roll out another health care bill   which will probably only make Trump s ratings plummet even more, considering how badly the first stab at Trumpcare hurt Trump s ratings.Trump loves boasting about his wins and records, but it s unlikely that he s going to want to brag about the fact that no president in history has gotten so unpopular so quickly   and the chances are, Trump is going to keep going down because he sabotages himself almost every day with his erratic behavior and social media habits.

,fake_true," Look Out, Big Oil: ‘Job Creation’ No Longer An Argument As Solar Outpaces Oil","While jobs in the solar energy sector account for 39 percent of all world-wide energy employment (while oil accounts for 50 percent), Fortune magazine reports that for the first time in quite a while, there are more openings for solar jobs than oil.Think about that. While the world burns for the next barrel of oil, green energy jobs are outpacing the status quo dirty energy that pulled the United States into a massive war.As Fortune finds:This [trend] corresponds with a recent report by The Solar Foundation that highlighted the rapid growth of the U.S. clean energy sector. By the end of this year, the solar sector should have 240,000 workers under its wings, and currently employs around 77% more workers than the coal mining industry.So why is this happening? Well, since the price of oil has plunged by 60 percent in the last 18 months has caused the world s largest oil and gas companies to cut jobs at an alarming rate. BP has announced it will cut 9 percent of its workforce while Chevron says it will cut 10 percent.This comes as reports show that global investment in renewable energy, most of which has come from China and India, heavy polluters, was more than twice that of coal and gas combined from last year s numbers.Tara Sinclair, chief economist of Indeed, issued a warning to those in the energy industry: see out renewable jobs, not oil.The decline in oil prices has not just rocked that industry, but jobs linked to both fossil fuels and renewable energy. Whether or not solar overtakes oil on Indeed, energy workers would do well to position themselves for work in renewable fields such as solar, wind, and hydroelectricity.With Clinton s pledge to build 600 million more solar fields and a promise to rebuild ravaged coal country with renewable energy, the amount of green workers could surge within the next several years (should she win).Is the country, and the world, moving towards a greener economy?

,fake_true, Thanks Obama! The 99 Percent Are Doing Better Than In 17 Years,"The very cornerstone of Bernie Sanders  campaign is income inequality, and there s a very good reason for that. The statistics are mind-blowing. After all, those in the top one percent make 184 times those in the bottom 90 percent. Yes, it s that bad, but for the first time in 17 years, the bottom 90 percent have seen some gains. Unfortunately, the top 1 percent have seen more gains.The top 1 percent income earners in the United States hit a new high last year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The bottom 99 percent of income earners registered the best real income growth (after factoring in inflation) in 17 years, but the top one percent did even better. The latest IRS data show that incomes for the bottom 99 percent of families grew by 3.9 percent over 2014 levels, the best annual growth rate since 1998, but incomes for those families in the top 1 percent of earners grew even faster, by 7.7 percent, over the same period.Source: Equitable GrowthThat might sound like a mixed bag, and it certainly is, but it does mark the first time since the Clinton administration where those who are struggling have seen real growth. Since the beginning of the 2009 recession, those below the top 10 percent have been seeing anemic 1.1 percent growth.While this news is pretty good, it s not great. To this day, the non-wealthy have only recovered 60 percent of lost wealth from the Great Recession. Things have been much, much better for those at the top:Income inequality in the United States persists at extremely high levels, particularly at the very top of the income ladder. Figure 1 shows that the incomes (adjusted for inflation) of the top 1 percent of families grew from $990,000 in 2009 to $1,360,000 in 2015, a growth of 37 percent. In contrast, the incomes of the bottom 99 percent of families grew only by 7.6 percent from $45,300 in 2009 to $48,800 in 2015. As a result, the top 1 percent of families captured 52 percent of total real income growth per family from 2009 to 2015 while the bottom 99 percent of families got only 48 percent of total real income growth. This uneven recovery is unfortunately on par with a long-term widening of inequality since 1980, when the top 1 percent of families began to capture a disproportionate share of economic growth.With Sanders all but out of the race, our attentions have to turn to what Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump might do to correct the problem.Trump plans very little, other than tax breaks for people making less than $25,000 a year. That does little to solve income inequality, but it could take enough money from the IRS that Republicans could claim that we, as taxpayers, can no longer afford food stamps or health care supplements.Clinton s plan is to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour, middle class green job creation, small business incentives, college assistance and tax assistance.Of course, don t look for any real improvements in income inequality until the Supreme Court rules that corporations are no longer people. Donald Trump is not going to give us that Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton vows that she will.Featured image via Alex Wong at Getty Images.","thanks obama! the 99 percent are doing better than in 17 years the very cornerstone of bernie sanders campaign is income inequality, and there s a very good reason for that. the statistics are mind-blowing. after all, those in the top one percent make 184 times those in the bottom 90 percent. yes, it s that bad, but for the first time in 17 years, the bottom 90 percent have seen some gains. unfortunately, the top 1 percent have seen more gains.the top 1 percent income earners in the united states hit a new high last year, according to the latest data from the u.s. internal revenue service. the bottom 99 percent of income earners registered the best real income growth (after factoring in inflation) in 17 years, but the top one percent did even better. the latest irs data show that incomes for the bottom 99 percent of families grew by 3.9 percent over 2014 levels, the best annual growth rate since 1998, but incomes for those families in the top 1 percent of earners grew even faster, by 7.7 percent, over the same period.source: equitable growththat might sound like a mixed bag, and it certainly is, but it does mark the first time since the clinton administration where those who are struggling have seen real growth. since the beginning of the 2009 recession, those below the top 10 percent have been seeing anemic 1.1 percent growth.while this news is pretty good, it s not great. to this day, the non-wealthy have only recovered 60 percent of lost wealth from the great recession. things have been much, much better for those at the top:income inequality in the united states persists at extremely high levels, particularly at the very top of the income ladder. figure 1 shows that the incomes (adjusted for inflation) of the top 1 percent of families grew from $990,000 in 2009 to $1,360,000 in 2015, a growth of 37 percent. in contrast, the incomes of the bottom 99 percent of families grew only by 7.6 percent from $45,300 in 2009 to $48,800 in 2015. as a result, the top 1 percent of families captured 52 percent of total real income growth per family from 2009 to 2015 while the bottom 99 percent of families got only 48 percent of total real income growth. this uneven recovery is unfortunately on par with a long-term widening of inequality since 1980, when the top 1 percent of families began to capture a disproportionate share of economic growth.with sanders all but out of the race, our attentions have to turn to what hillary clinton and donald trump might do to correct the problem.trump plans very little, other than tax breaks for people making less than $25,000 a year. that does little to solve income inequality, but it could take enough money from the irs that republicans could claim that we, as taxpayers, can no longer afford food stamps or health care supplements.clinton s plan is to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour, middle class green job creation, small business incentives, college assistance and tax assistance.of course, don t look for any real improvements in income inequality until the supreme court rules that corporations are no longer people. donald trump is not going to give us that supreme court. hillary clinton vows that she will.featured image via alex wong at getty images.",0,1,0.8250036752909445,0.32500367529094454,false_positive
